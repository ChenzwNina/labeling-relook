Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component uses a two-column flexbox layout on a clean white card with rounded corners and a subtle box-shadow, giving it a modern, elevated feel. The left column is dedicated to the product image, while the right contains all textual information and interactive elements.

The color scheme is professional and focused: primary text is a dark charcoal (#343a40) for high readability. A vibrant blue (#007bff) is used for the main "Add to Cart" button and selection highlights, drawing the user's primary attention. A sharp red (#dc3545) is reserved for the sale price to create urgency.

Element sizing establishes a clear visual hierarchy. The product title is the largest text element (2em), followed by the sale price (1.8em). This ensures the most critical information is seen first. Interactive elements like buttons and option selectors are large and have generous spacing, making them easy to tap on any device. These choices create a scannable, trustworthy, and user-friendly interface that guides the user efficiently towards making a purchase decision.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This component is a primary element of a Product Detail Page (PDP). Its appearance is triggered when a user navigates to this page. The typical user journey involves the user first viewing a list of products on a category page or search results page. When the user clicks on a specific product from that list to learn more, they are directed to the PDP, and this component loads as the main content of that page. It is not a dynamic widget that appears based on an action (like a popup or notification), but rather a static, foundational component of a core e-commerce page.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can perform several actions, each providing clear feedback.
1.  **Select a Size:** Clicking a size option (e.g., 'M') applies a blue border and light blue background to the selected box, visually confirming the choice.
2.  **Select a Color:** Clicking a color swatch applies a prominent blue outer ring, indicating the current selection.
3.  **Adjust Quantity:** Users can click the '+' and '−' buttons to change the quantity. The '−' button is disabled when the quantity is 1, preventing an invalid state. Hovering on the buttons provides a subtle background change.
4.  **Add to Wishlist:** Clicking the heart icon provides a hover effect. In a full implementation, it would change color (e.g., fill with red) to confirm the item has been saved.
5.  **Add to Cart:** This is the primary call-to-action. Hovering over the button darkens its color. Clicking it provides a visual press-down effect (transform: scale(0.98)) and would typically trigger a confirmation message or a mini-cart animation.
