Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The shopping cart widget is a rectangular container with rounded corners, positioned on the top-right of the screen. It has a clean, modern aesthetic with a white background (`#ffffff`) and dark grey text (`#172B4D`) for high contrast and readability. The layout is a vertical flex column divided into a header, a scrollable item list, and a footer. The primary call-to-action, the "Proceed to Checkout" button, is large, full-width, and rendered in a vibrant blue (`#0052CC`) to immediately draw the user's eye, signifying it as the main goal. Prices are also highlighted in blue to make them easy to spot. The layout is fixed so it remains accessible as the user scrolls the main page. This design promotes clarity, minimizes distraction, and efficiently guides the user toward completing their purchase, adhering to principles of good e-commerce UX.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The primary trigger for this widget's appearance is a user clicking on a shopping cart icon, typically located in the website's main header. This action would cause the cart widget to slide or fade into view from the side of the screen. An alternative trigger could be the user clicking an "Add to Cart" button on a product detail page. In this scenario, the widget would appear automatically to provide immediate visual confirmation that the item has been successfully added to their cart. This instant feedback reassures the user and allows them to quickly review their cart's contents or adjust quantities without needing to navigate to a separate, full-page cart view, thus streamlining the shopping experience.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several key interactions with this widget, designed for efficient cart management. They can:
1.  **Close the widget:** By clicking the 'Ã—' button in the header or the "Continue Shopping" link in the footer.
2.  **Review items:** Users can see a list of their added products, including images, names, selected options (like color/size), and individual prices.
3.  **Adjust quantity:** Each item has '+' and '-' buttons and a number input field to increase, decrease, or manually type the desired quantity. The input is restricted to positive numbers.
4.  **Remove an item:** A "Remove" button next to each item allows for its complete deletion from the cart.
5.  **View subtotal:** The footer clearly displays the total cost of all items.
6.  **Proceed to checkout:** The primary blue button navigates the user to the full checkout page to complete their purchase.
7.  **Scroll:** If the list of items is too long to fit, the central area becomes scrollable.
