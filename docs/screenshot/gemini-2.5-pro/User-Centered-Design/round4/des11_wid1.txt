### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a clean, modern-looking modal window centered at the top of the screen. It has a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle box-shadow, making it float above the main page content and drawing the user's focus. The headline is large and bold for immediate clarity. 

The color palette is intentional. The "No, Keep My Benefits" button is a welcoming, solid blue (`#007bff`), representing a positive, primary action. In contrast, the "Yes, Cancel Membership" button uses a dangerous red (`#dc3545`) for the text and border, signaling a destructive action that requires caution. This color choice creates a slight psychological friction, encouraging users to reconsider the permanent decision. The benefits list has a light gray background with green checkmarks, visually reinforcing the positive value they are about to lose. The layout is spacious and uses a legible 'Lato' font for a comfortable reading experience.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget is not a random pop-up. Its appearance is triggered by a direct and intentional user action. On an e-commerce website, the user would first need to navigate to their personal account section, find the "My Membership" or "Subscription" page, and then click on a link or button explicitly labeled "Cancel Membership" or "Manage Subscription". This modal then serves as a confirmation and retention step, ensuring the user is certain about their decision and giving the business a final opportunity to retain them by reminding them of the value they receive. This respects the user's journey and avoids being intrusive.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several clear interaction paths with this widget:

1.  **Keep Membership:** Clicking the primary blue button, "No, Keep My Benefits," would close the modal and cancel the cancellation process, returning the user to their account page with their membership intact.
2.  **Confirm Cancellation:** Clicking the secondary red-accented button, "Yes, Cancel Membership," would proceed with the cancellation. In a real application, this would likely navigate to a final confirmation page stating the membership has been successfully terminated.
3.  **Dismiss:** Clicking the 'X' icon in the top-right corner acts as a non-committal way to close the widget, effectively having the same outcome as deciding to keep the membership.
4.  **Provide Feedback:** Users can optionally interact with the dropdown menu to select a reason for their cancellation. This interaction is for data gathering and does not change the function of the main action buttons.
5.  **Hover States:** Hovering over any button or the close icon provides immediate visual feedback (color change, shadow effect), confirming that the elements are interactive.
