### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The search panel is a clean, rectangular component with soft, 8px rounded corners. It has a white background, a light grey border, and a subtle drop shadow to make it "float" above the page content. The layout is a horizontal flexbox arrangement. On the left, there's a category dropdown with a clear separator line. In the center is a large text input field, and on the right is a search button containing only a magnifying glass icon. 

These choices create a modern, trustworthy, and user-friendly aesthetic. The white background and grey tones provide high contrast and readability. The large, 54px height makes it easy to interact with. Blue is used as an accent for focus and hover states, providing clear visual feedback without being distracting. This minimalist design focuses the user's attention on the primary task: searching for a product.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This component is not triggered by a user action; it is a persistent element. It is rendered with `position: fixed` and is always visible at the top of the viewport, 20 pixels from the edge, regardless of how far the user scrolls down the page. This design choice ensures that the search functionality, a critical feature for an e-commerce site, is constantly and immediately accessible. By keeping it in a predictable location, we reduce the user's cognitive load, as they don't have to hunt for the search bar or scroll back to the top of the page to find a product. This promotes efficient navigation and improves the overall user experience.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have three primary interactions with the search panel:

1.  **Refining Search Scope:** The user can click on the "All Categories" dropdown on the left. This action will open a list of predefined product categories (e.g., "Electronics", "Men's Fashion"). Selecting a category from this list constrains their subsequent search to only that part of the store, helping them find relevant items more quickly.

2.  **Entering a Search Query:** The user can click into the main text input field. This action gives the entire panel a blue-tinted border and shadow, providing clear feedback that it's active. The user can then type their desired product, brand, or keyword, such as "wireless noise-cancelling headphones".

3.  **Initiating the Search:** After typing a query, the user can either press the `Enter` key on their keyboard or click the magnifying glass icon button. Hovering over the button provides visual feedback by changing its background to a light blue. This action submits the form and would navigate the user to the search results page.
