Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    
    The shopping cart widget is a vertical panel with a clean, modern aesthetic, positioned on the top right of the screen. It has a white background with soft shadows to make it stand out. The layout is structured into three main parts: a header, a scrollable item list, and a footer. The header contains the title "Your Cart" and a close '×' button. The item list displays each product with a 70x70px image, product details (name, color, size), and actions (quantity controls, remove link). The footer presents the subtotal and two prominent call-to-action buttons.

    The color scheme uses a primary blue (#007bff) for the main "Checkout" button to draw the user's attention to the most important action. Gray tones are used for text and secondary elements to ensure readability and a clean look, while a touch of red is reserved for the "Remove" link's hover state, indicating a destructive action. This hierarchical use of color and size—larger fonts for totals, prominent buttons—guides the user's focus efficiently, creating a familiar and intuitive experience consistent with modern e-commerce design patterns.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    
    The appearance of this shopping cart widget is typically triggered by a user action, most commonly clicking on a shopping cart icon. This icon is almost universally located in the main header or navigation bar of the e-commerce website, ensuring it is always visible and accessible to the user as they browse. When the user adds an item to their cart, the widget might also briefly appear or animate to provide immediate feedback that the item was successfully added, before hiding again. However, its primary and persistent trigger is the direct click on the main cart icon, allowing users to review their selected items at any point in their shopping journey without navigating away from their current page.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
    
    Users can perform several key tasks directly within the widget for an efficient experience. The full range of interactions includes:
    1.  **Viewing:** Users can instantly see a summary of all items in their cart, including the name, specific attributes (like size and color), a thumbnail image, and the price of each item. They can also view the subtotal.
    2.  **Quantity Adjustment:** Each item has '+' and '-' buttons and a number input, allowing users to increase or decrease the quantity of that specific product. The input is constrained to a minimum of one.
    3.  **Item Removal:** A "Remove" link is available for each item, allowing users to delete a product from their cart with a single click.
    4.  **Proceeding to Checkout:** The primary, high-contrast "Proceed to Checkout" button navigates the user to the next step in the purchasing process.
    5.  **Viewing Full Cart:** A secondary "View Full Cart" button provides an option to navigate to a dedicated, more detailed shopping cart page.
    6.  **Closing the Widget:** Users can dismiss the widget by clicking the '×' button in the header, allowing them to return to their browsing.
