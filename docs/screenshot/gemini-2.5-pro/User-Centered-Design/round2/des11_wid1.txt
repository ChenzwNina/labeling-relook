Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a modal-like box with a white background (#FFFFFF) and a subtle border (#e0e0e0) and shadow, giving it a clean, floating appearance. It's approximately 580px wide (responsive) and positioned 20px from the top of the viewport, horizontally centered.
Text is primarily dark gray (#333333, #555555) for readability. Headings (H2: 22px, H3: 18px) provide clear hierarchy. Body text and list items are around 15px.
Key colors for actions are:
- Green (#28a745) for "Keep My Membership": Positive, encourages retention.
- Blue (#007bff) for "Pause My Membership": Neutral, constructive alternative.
- Red (#dc3545) for "Yes, Cancel Membership": Standard for destructive/warning actions.
Benefits are listed with green checkmarks for positive reinforcement.
The layout is structured into sections: initial information, a retention offer (pause), and the final decision. Buttons are large, with clear text, and appropriate spacing. The "Pause" button is full-width within its section to draw attention. "Keep" and "Cancel" buttons are side-by-side, sharing space in the final action area. A standard '×' close button is at the top right.

These choices enhance clarity (Rule 3.1), provide clear affordances (Rule 3.5), ensure information hierarchy, and use standard color psychology for user actions to guide them efficiently (Rule 3.6) and create a helpful, less stressful cancellation experience (Rule 3.7).

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is typically triggered by a direct user action within their account or subscription management section of the e-commerce website. For example, the user might navigate to "My Memberships," find their "Gold Tier Membership," and click on an option like "Manage Subscription" or directly on a "Cancel Membership" link or button. This action signifies the user's intent to terminate their subscription, and the widget appears as the next step in that process, usually as a modal dialog to confirm their decision and present alternatives. It's not something that would appear unprompted.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several distinct interaction paths with this widget:
1.  **Read Information**: They can read the initial message about cancellation, the list of benefits they will lose, and the effective date of cancellation.
2.  **Consider Pausing**: They can read the "Pause Membership" offer. If interested, they can click the "Pause My Membership (Up to 3 Months)" button. This action would typically lead to another interface or step to configure the pause duration and confirm, then close this widget.
3.  **Decide to Keep Membership**: If they reconsider, they can click the "No, Keep My Membership" button. This action would typically close the widget and return them to their account page, with their membership remaining active.
4.  **Proceed with Cancellation**: If they are sure about cancelling, they can click the "Yes, Cancel Membership" button. This action would likely lead to a final confirmation message (e.g., "Your membership has been cancelled") or potentially a brief exit survey, and then the widget would close or navigate them away.
5.  **Close the Widget**: Users can click the '×' (close) button at the top-right. This action is generally interpreted as abandoning the cancellation process, similar to clicking "No, Keep My Membership," and would dismiss the widget.

Each button provides clear visual feedback (hover and active states) when interacted with.
