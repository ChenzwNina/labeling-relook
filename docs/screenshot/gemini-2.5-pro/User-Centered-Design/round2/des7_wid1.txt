Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    The widget is a rectangular card with rounded corners (8px radius) and a subtle box shadow, giving it a modern, clean "floating" appearance. It has a fixed width of 450px, centered horizontally, and positioned 20px from the top of the viewport.
    Colors: The card background is white (#FFFFFF). Text uses various shades of gray for hierarchy: a dark #1a1a1a for the main title ("Customer Feedback"), #2c3e50 (a deep blue-gray) for the prominent average score, and other grays (#333, #444, #555) for supporting text. Stars and progress bars use a vibrant gold/yellow (#f39c12), a universally recognized color for ratings. Empty stars are a light gray (#d3d3d3). The "Write Your Review" button is a primary blue (#007bff), while "Read All Reviews" is a lighter gray (#f0f0f0) with a border, indicating a secondary action.
    Sizes & Layout: The average score ("4.7") is large (36px) and bold. Star icons are 24px. The main title is 22px. The layout is vertical: 1. Header with title and overall rating. 2. A list of rating breakdowns (5-star to 1-star) with labels, progress bars, and review counts. 3. Action buttons at the bottom. Flexbox ensures proper alignment within sections.
    Design Choices: These choices prioritize clarity, trust, and usability. The familiar e-commerce aesthetic (clean card, standard colors) makes it instantly recognizable. Prominent display of the average rating and review count provides key information quickly. Visual hierarchy guides users from summary to details to actions. Fixed positioning keeps this crucial social proof accessible.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    This ratings widget is designed to be an integral part of a product detail page on an e-commerce website. Its appearance is triggered by the loading of this product page in the user's browser. It's not typically activated by a specific user interaction (like a click or hover) but is rendered as part of the page's static layout. The CSS `position: fixed; top: 20px;` ensures it is displayed at the top of the viewport as soon as the relevant section of the HTML is processed by the browser, remaining visible as the user scrolls.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
    Users can interact with the widget in several ways:
    1.  **Information Consumption:** Primarily, users view the overall average star rating (e.g., "4.7"), the star visualization, the total number of reviews, and the detailed breakdown of ratings per star level (via progress bars and counts). This helps them quickly assess product sentiment.
    2.  **"Read All Reviews" Link:** Clicking this link (styled as a secondary button) navigates the user to a section or page where all individual customer reviews are displayed. In this example, it's an anchor link to `#all-reviews` on the same page.
    3.  **"Write Your Review" Button:** Clicking this button (styled as a primary action) would typically trigger a modal/pop-up form for submitting a new review, or navigate to a separate review submission page.
    4.  **Hover Effects:** Buttons provide visual feedback on hover (color change, slight lift) to indicate interactivity and improve affordance.
    The star icons and progress bars are primarily for visual information display; in this design, they are not interactive elements for filtering reviews, though such functionality could be an enhancement.
