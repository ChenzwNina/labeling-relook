Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    Answer:
    The "Featured Products" widget has a clean and modern aesthetic. The overall page background is a light gray (#f8f9fa), providing a soft canvas. The component itself is housed in a section with a maximum width (1200px) and centered, ensuring comfortable viewing on large screens, with a 20px top margin.
    Product cards are white (#ffffff) with subtle borders (#e0e0e0) and soft shadows, giving them a slight "lifted" appearance. They feature rounded corners (8px) for a friendlier look. Product images have a fixed height (220px) and use `object-fit: cover` to maintain aspect ratios and visual consistency.
    The section title ("Discover Our Featured Selection") is large (2em), centered, and colored in a dark blue-gray (#2c3e50). Product names are a slightly softer dark color (#34495e, 1.15em), while prices are prominent (1.3em) and use an accent blue (#007bff) to draw attention. Action buttons ("Add to Cart", "View Details", "Learn More") are styled with a primary blue (#007bff) or a secondary teal (#17a2b8), uppercase text, and generous padding for high visibility and clickability.
    The layout uses a responsive CSS grid (`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))`) for product cards, allowing them to adapt from a single column on small screens to multiple columns on larger screens.
    These choices are made to create a visually appealing, trustworthy, and user-friendly experience, common in modern e-commerce. Clarity of information, easy navigation cues (hover effects), and clear calls to action are prioritized to help users discover products and encourage engagement.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    Answer:
    This "Featured Products" widget is designed to be a static content section, typically appearing on an e-commerce website's homepage, a category page, or a dedicated "Featured" or "New Arrivals" page. Its appearance is triggered by the user navigating to and loading such a page. It's not a pop-up or dynamically injected element based on a specific user action (like a click or scroll event that reveals hidden content). It's part of the primary content flow of the page and is visible as soon as that part of the page loads and renders in the browser. The `margin-top: 20px` ensures it has spacing from the top of the viewport or elements above it.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
    Answer:
    Users can interact with the "Featured Products" widget in several ways:
    1.  **Visual Scanning & Information Consumption:** Users can visually scan the grid of products, quickly taking in product images, names, and prices to identify items of interest.
    2.  **Hover Interactions (Visual Feedback):**
        *   Hovering over a product card causes it to slightly lift and its shadow to become more pronounced, indicating it's an interactive element.
        *   Hovering over an action button (e.g., "Add to Cart") changes its background color and may cause a slight lift, signaling clickability.
    3.  **Click Interactions (Implied):**
        *   Clicking on a product image or product name would typically navigate the user to the detailed product page for that item (though this functionality requires JavaScript and backend logic not included in this static HTML/CSS component).
        *   Clicking an "Add to Cart" button would typically add the product to the user's shopping cart, often providing feedback like a quick animation or a mini-cart update.
        *   Clicking a "View Details" or "Learn More" button would navigate to the product detail page.
    These click actions are standard e-commerce behaviors that the visual design of the buttons and product elements strongly affords, even if not functionally implemented in this static example.
