Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The filter panel widget is a vertical rectangle, 320px wide, positioned 20px from the top and left of the viewport. It has a light theme with a white background (#ffffff) and a subtle box-shadow for depth. The overall page background is a light gray (#f4f6f8) to make the panel stand out.
Text is primarily dark gray (#333, #495057) for readability. A vibrant blue (#007bff) serves as the primary accent color for interactive elements like selected states, buttons, and slider controls, chosen for its common association with trust and action in UIs.
The layout is organized into sections (Category, Brand, Price, etc.), each with a clear heading (font size 1.05em, weight 600). Filter options (checkboxes, color swatches, size buttons) are sized for easy interaction (e.g., color swatches 30x30px, size buttons well-padded). The panel has a header with a title ("Filter Products", 1.5em) and a close button. Action buttons ("Clear All", "Apply Filters") are at the bottom, prominently styled.
These choices aim for a clean, modern e-commerce aesthetic, prioritizing clarity, ease of use, and high visibility of functions. Spacing and typography choices enhance scannability and reduce cognitive load.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The filter panel widget can be configured in a few ways:
1.  **Always Visible:** On product listing pages or category pages, it can be displayed by default, typically as a sidebar, allowing users to refine product searches immediately. The provided HTML/CSS renders it as visible by default.
2.  **User-Triggered:** It can be initially hidden and then appear when a user clicks a dedicated "Filters" button or icon (not part of this component but usually present on the main page content area or app bar).
3.  **Contextual Appearance:** It might appear automatically in response to certain user actions, like initiating a search.

The component includes a close button ('×') in its header, allowing users to hide it if it's persistent or dismiss it if it's a modal/pop-over. The provided JavaScript simply hides the panel; a real application would manage its visibility state more robustly.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can interact with the filter panel in the following ways:
1.  **Select/Deselect Categories & Brands:** Using checkboxes for multi-selection.
2.  **Set Price Range:**
    *   By dragging two range slider thumbs (min and max).
    *   By typing exact values into number input fields for minimum and maximum price. The sliders and input fields are synchronized.
3.  **Choose Colors:** By clicking on color swatches. Multiple colors can be selected (toggling selection). Selected swatches are visually highlighted with a border and a checkmark.
4.  **Select Sizes:** By clicking on size buttons (e.g., S, M, L). Multiple sizes can be selected (toggling selection). Selected buttons change appearance.
5.  **Filter by Customer Rating:** By selecting a minimum star rating using radio buttons (single selection).
6.  **Apply Filters:** By clicking the "Apply Filters" button, which would typically trigger a product list update based on the selected criteria.
7.  **Clear Filters:** By clicking the "Clear All" button, which resets all filter options to their default states (e.g., unchecks boxes, resets price range, clears color/size selections).
8.  **Close Panel:** By clicking the '×' icon in the header to hide the filter panel.
Hover effects provide visual feedback on all interactive elements before clicking.
