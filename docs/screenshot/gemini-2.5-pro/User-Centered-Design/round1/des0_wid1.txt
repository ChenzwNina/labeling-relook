Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The "Featured Selections" component has a clean and modern aesthetic. It's housed in a white container with a soft shadow, set against a light gray page background (`#f4f6f8`), giving it a distinct, elevated presence. The main title "Our Featured Selections" is prominent in a dark blue-gray (`#2c3e50`) and centered.
    Products are displayed in a responsive grid (flexbox) with individual product cards. Each card (`280px` wide) has a white background, subtle border (`#e0e0e0`), and rounded corners (`10px`). Product images are `220px` high with `object-fit: cover`. Product names are dark blue (`#34495e`), links hover to a primary blue (`#007bff`), and prices are a vibrant green (`#27ae60`) for sale prices, with original prices in gray and strikethrough. "Add to Cart" buttons are a primary blue (`#007bff`), full-width within the card, and provide hover/active feedback.
    These choices prioritize clarity, readability, and trust. Contrasting colors guide the user's attention to CTAs. Consistent card design aids scannability. The overall palette is professional and inviting, common in e-commerce for a reliable feel.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    This "Featured Selections" component is designed as a static section of a webpage, typically on a homepage, a category landing page, or a special promotions page. Its appearance is triggered by the page loading in the user's browser. It's not a dynamic widget that appears based on a specific user action (like a click or scroll event causing a modal to pop up). Instead, it's an integral part of the initial page content, intended to immediately showcase key products to visitors as soon as they access the relevant page.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users can interact with the "Featured Selections" component in several ways:
    1.  **Visual Scanning:** Users can quickly scan the product grid to view images, names, and prices.
    2.  **Hovering over Product Cards:** When a user hovers their mouse over a product card, the card slightly lifts and its shadow intensifies. This provides visual feedback that the card is an interactive element.
    3.  **Clicking Product Image/Name:** Both the product image and the product name are wrapped in links. Clicking on either will navigate the user to the respective product details page (currently stubbed to `#product-details-page-X`). The product name also changes color on hover to indicate clickability.
    4.  **Viewing Price Information:** Users can see current prices clearly. If a product is on sale, the discounted price is prominent, and the original price is shown with a strikethrough.
    5.  **Clicking "Add to Cart" Button:** Each product card has an "Add to Cart" button. Clicking this button would typically initiate the process of adding the item to the user's shopping cart. The button provides visual feedback on hover (color change) and active (slight shrink) states.
