Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    
    The widget is a clean, modern account creation form presented as a card.
    Layout: It's a single-column form, centered on the page against a light grey background. The form itself is white with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, giving it a floating appearance. Elements like the title ("Create Your Account"), a brief sub-heading, input fields with labels, a terms agreement checkbox, and the primary action button are vertically stacked. A link for existing users to log in is placed at the bottom. This vertical flow is intuitive and common for forms, aiding scannability.
    Colors:
    - Page Background: Light grey (`#f0f2f5`) to make the form prominent.
    - Form Container: White (`#ffffff`) for a clean, trustworthy feel.
    - Text: Dark grey (`#333333` for titles/labels, `#555555` for sub-text) for strong readability.
    - Inputs: Light grey borders (`#ced4da`), focusing to a brighter blue (`#007bff`) with a soft glow.
    - Primary Action: A vibrant blue (`#007bff`) for the "Create My Account" button and interactive links, signifying clickable elements and drawing attention to key actions.
    Size of Elements:
    - The form has a `max-width` of `450px` for optimal line length and readability on desktop, and it's responsive for smaller screens.
    - Input fields and buttons have generous padding (12px) for a comfortable touch/click target and modern aesthetic.
    - Font sizes are hierarchical: a larger title (24px), standard body text (14-15px), and clear labels.
    Design Choices Rationale: The design choices prioritize clarity, ease of use, and a professional appearance suitable for an e-commerce platform. The color scheme uses high contrast for readability and a familiar "action blue" for interactive elements. The layout is standard, reducing cognitive load. Rounded corners and subtle shadows contribute to a softer, more contemporary feel. These elements combine to create a trustworthy and efficient user experience for account creation.

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The appearance of this account creation widget is typically triggered by explicit user actions indicating a desire to register on the e-commerce website. Common triggers include:
    1.  Clicking a "Sign Up," "Register," or "Create Account" link or button. These are usually found in the website's main navigation header, sometimes in the footer, or prominently on a dedicated login page (e.g., "Don't have an account? Sign Up").
    2.  Direct navigation to the registration URL (e.g., `www.ecommerce-site.com/register`).
    3.  During the checkout process, if the user is new and is presented with an option to create an account for future convenience, rather than checking out as a guest.
    4.  In some scenarios, attempting an action that requires a registered user (like saving items to a persistent wishlist or accessing order history) might redirect or prompt the user to create an account, potentially displaying this form or a similar one.
    For this static component, it's rendered directly, but in a live application, it would be part of a specific page or flow initiated by one of these actions.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users can engage with the account creation widget through several interactions:
    1.  **Data Entry:** Users can click on or tab to each input field ("Full Name," "Email Address," "Password," "Confirm Password") and type in their information. Placeholder text provides guidance (e.g., "e.g., Jordan Lee," "Minimum 8 characters").
    2.  **Password Masking:** Text entered into "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields is automatically masked (dots or asterisks) for security.
    3.  **Checkbox Selection:** Users must click the checkbox to agree to the "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy." This is a required action for form submission.
    4.  **Link Navigation (Terms/Policy):** The "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" texts are hyperlinks. Users can click these to open and review the respective documents (ideally in a new tab or modal).
    5.  **Form Submission:** Clicking the "Create My Account" button attempts to submit the form. HTML5 validation (e.g., `required`, `type="email"`, `minlength`) will prevent submission and display browser-native error messages if fields are incomplete or incorrectly formatted.
    6.  **Focus Indication:** When an input field is selected, its border changes color and a subtle shadow appears, providing clear visual feedback of the active element.
    7.  **Navigation to Login:** Users who already have an account can click the "Log In Here" link, which would typically navigate them to the website's login page.
    8.  **Hover Effects:** Interactive elements like the submit button and links show visual feedback (e.g., color change) on mouse hover, indicating clickability.
