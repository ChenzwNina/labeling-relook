Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    The widget is a rectangular card, up to 750px wide, centered horizontally at the top of the viewport with a 20px top margin. It features a clean white background (#ffffff) with a subtle shadow for depth, creating a modern floating appearance.
    Colors:
    - Text: Dark grays (#333, #2c3e50) ensure high readability.
    - Accent/Interactive: A vibrant blue (#007bff) is used for buttons, links, and the active progress step, guiding user attention to interactive elements and key status information.
    - Success/Completed: Green (#28a745) visually confirms completed stages in the progress tracker.
    - Neutral/Backgrounds: Light grays and blues (#f0f4f8, #e9f5ff, #f8f9fa, #e0e0e0) provide subtle structure for different sections and inactive elements.
    Sizes:
    - Main Title (H2): 22px for prominence.
    - Body Text: 14-15px for easy reading.
    - Progress Icons: 30x30px circles, clearly visible.
    - Buttons: Padded (e.g., 12px 22px) for comfortable interaction.
    Layout:
    - Header: Title and Order ID.
    - Order Summary: Key details like ETA and item snippet.
    - Progress Tracker: A five-step horizontal bar showing shipment stages.
    - Current Status: A highlighted box with a clear, friendly status message.
    - Tracking Details: Tracking number, carrier link, and a copy button.
    - Actions: Buttons ("View Full Order", "Customer Support") aligned to the right at the bottom.
    Design Rationale: Choices prioritize clarity (high contrast, legible fonts like Arial), visual hierarchy (guiding the eye to status and actions), familiarity (standard e-commerce patterns), efficiency (key info upfront), and trust (polished, reassuring design).

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    This widget typically appears when a user actively seeks to track their order. Common triggers include:
    1.  Clicking a "Track Order" link or button, often found in their order history, a shipment confirmation email, or a dedicated "Track My Order" section of the website (potentially after entering an order ID).
    2.  Navigating to a specific Order Details page where tracking information is a primary component, especially if the order is in a trackable state (e.g., shipped).
    3.  Successfully submitting an order ID and associated identifier (like email or zip code) on a public-facing order tracking form, if the e-commerce site provides one.
    It's designed as a primary content display for tracking, rather than a transient notification.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
    Users can interact with the widget in several ways:
    1.  **Visual Information Consumption:** The main interaction is viewing the order status, estimated delivery, item summary, and the visual progress bar to quickly understand the shipment's current stage.
    2.  **Copy Tracking Number:** A "Copy" button next to the tracking number allows users to copy it to their clipboard (this would require JavaScript for full functionality). The button has hover feedback.
    3.  **Navigate to Carrier Website:** The carrier's name is a clickable link, directing the user to the carrier's tracking portal, potentially pre-filling the tracking number.
    4.  **View Full Order Details:** The "View Full Order" button navigates to a more comprehensive page detailing all order aspects (items, addresses, billing).
    5.  **Contact Support:** The "Customer Support" button would link to a support page, open a contact form/modal, or initiate a chat for assistance.
    6.  **Hover Effects:** All interactive elements like buttons and links exhibit hover states (e.g., color changes) to provide visual feedback and clearly indicate their clickability, enhancing affordance.
