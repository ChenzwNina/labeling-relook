Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a modal dialog, approximately 520px wide, designed to appear 20px from the top of the viewport.
-   **Layout:** It features a header, body, and footer. The header (light grey background: #f5f6f7) contains the title ("Cancel 'StyleSavvy Insider' Membership?") and a close 'X' button. The body (white background: #ffffff) presents informational text, lists benefits being lost (each with a green '✓' icon), highlights an important notice in a yellow box, and poses a confirmation question. The footer (matching header background) holds two main action buttons: "No, Keep My Benefits" and "Yes, Cancel Membership". The layout is responsive, stacking buttons on smaller screens.
-   **Colors:** The primary color scheme is neutral with strategic use of color. Text is dark grey (#1c1e21, #4b4f56) for readability. The "Yes, Cancel" button is a distinct red (#e74c3c) signifying a consequential action. The "No, Keep" button is a lighter grey (#e4e6eb) to be less visually dominant. Benefit icons are green (#38a169), and the notice box uses light yellow (#fff3cd).
-   **Element Sizes:** The title is 20px and bold. Body text is 15-16px. Buttons have padding (10px 16px) and 15px bold text for clear click targets.
These choices prioritize clarity and user guidance. The modal nature prevents accidental clicks elsewhere. Colors and button hierarchy guide users to the most common or safest path while making the critical action clear (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.5). The consistent structure and responsive design enhance usability across devices (Rule 3.4, 3.6, 3.7).

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this membership cancellation widget is triggered by a specific user action indicating their intent to cancel an existing membership. Typically, this occurs when the user is in their account settings or a dedicated subscription management section of the e-commerce website.

For instance, the user might:
1.  Navigate to "My Account" > "Manage Membership" or "Subscription Details".
2.  Locate and click on a button or link explicitly labeled "Cancel Membership," "End Subscription," or similar.

Upon this click, JavaScript on the page would invoke a function (like the `showWidget()` example) to display this modal. It serves as a crucial confirmation step, ensuring the user deliberately intends to cancel and understands the implications (Rule 3.3), rather than appearing unexpectedly. This makes the interaction helpful and contextually relevant (Rule 3.7).

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can interact with the membership cancellation widget in several ways:

1.  **Read Information:** Users can absorb the details presented: the specific membership name, the consequences of cancellation, a list of benefits they will lose (e.g., "Unlimited Free Same-Day Delivery"), the date their current benefits expire, and an important notice regarding potential loss of promotional pricing.
2.  **Click "No, Keep My Benefits":** This secondary action button allows the user to reconsider and abort the cancellation process. Clicking it closes the widget, and their membership remains active. This provides an easy "escape hatch" (Rule 3.6).
3.  **Click "Yes, Cancel Membership":** This primary, destructive action button confirms the user's intent to cancel. Upon clicking, the widget's content updates to display a success message (e.g., "Your 'StyleSavvy Insider' Membership is Cancelled") and a final "Okay, Got It" button (Rule 3.2).
4.  **Click the Close Button ('X'):** Located in the widget's header, this button provides a standard way to dismiss the dialog. Functionally, it acts like "No, Keep My Benefits," closing the widget without cancelling the membership (Rule 3.4, 3.5).
5.  **Click "Okay, Got It" (Post-Confirmation):** After successfully cancelling, this button appears on the confirmation screen. Clicking it dismisses the widget entirely.

These interactions offer clear choices, immediate feedback, and allow users to efficiently complete their intended task or reverse their decision, contributing to a helpful experience (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, 3.7).
