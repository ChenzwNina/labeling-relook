Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
    Response:
    The widget is a clean, card-style form, approximately 420px wide, ensuring it's compact yet readable. It features a white background (#ffffff) with a subtle box-shadow for depth, set against a light grey page background (#e9ecef).
    Text uses a dark grey (#333, #2c3e50) for high contrast and readability. The primary action color is a vibrant blue (#007bff) for buttons, links, and focus states, chosen to inspire trust and guide user action.
    Input fields have light grey borders (#ced4da) that highlight in blue on focus.
    The layout is a single vertical column for form elements, promoting a clear, step-by-step completion process. Headings are larger (26px) than descriptive text (15px) and labels (14px) for visual hierarchy.
    These choices aim for a modern, trustworthy e-commerce aesthetic that is easy to use, visually appealing, and encourages sign-ups by being clear and professional (Rules 3.1, 3.4, 3.7).

    Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    Response:
    Typically, this membership signup widget would appear when a user interacts with a specific call-to-action on the e-commerce site. Common triggers include:
    1. Clicking a "Sign Up," "Register," or "Join Now" button, often located in the website's main navigation header or footer.
    2. Interacting with a promotional banner or pop-up advertising membership benefits.
    3. Attempting to access member-exclusive content or features.
    For this static demonstration, the widget is rendered directly and fixed at the top of the viewport (20px margin) to showcase its design as an overlay or prominent feature, implying it would be dynamically shown in a live environment.

    Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
    Response:
    Users can engage with the widget in several ways:
    1.  **Text Input:** Enter their full name, email address, and desired password into the designated input fields. Fields provide visual feedback (border color change, shadow) upon focus. Placeholder text guides data entry. Input fields also have 'required' attributes.
    2.  **Checkbox Interaction:** Click the checkbox to confirm agreement with the "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy." This is a mandatory step for account creation.
    3.  **Link Navigation:** Click on hypertext links for "Terms of Service," "Privacy Policy," and "Sign In." These would typically navigate to respective pages (placeholders in this static version).
    4.  **Form Submission:** Click the "Create My Account & Get Rewards" button. This button has hover and active states for visual feedback. In a functional site, this action would submit the form data for processing.
    These interactions are designed to be intuitive and provide clear feedback, facilitating an efficient and satisfying signup process (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6).
