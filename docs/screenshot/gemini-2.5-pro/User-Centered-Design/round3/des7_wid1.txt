Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
Answer: The component is a clean, card-style widget with a white background and a subtle shadow, making it float above the page content. It's centered horizontally and has a responsive width. The layout is structured in three clear sections. The top summary section features a very large, bold "4.6" for immediate impact, followed by five star icons and the total review count. The middle section provides a percentage breakdown for each star level using horizontal progress bars. The bottom section contains a prominent, full-width call-to-action button.
Colors are conventional for high usability: a vibrant gold (#FFC107) for stars and progress bars clearly signifies 'rating,' while a primary blue (#007bff) for the button signals a key action. Secondary text is a soft grey (#6c757d) to create visual hierarchy. This design prioritizes scannability and familiarity, allowing users to quickly assess product quality and know how to act, thus creating an efficient and satisfying experience.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
Answer: The appearance of this widget is triggered by a **page load event** on a product detail page. It is a static, foundational piece of information, not a dynamic element that appears based on user interaction like a click or hover. Its purpose is to provide immediate social proof and a quality summary the moment a potential customer views a product. Therefore, it loads along with the product's title, image, and price, ensuring this critical decision-making information is visible to the user from the very beginning of their engagement with the product page.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
Answer: Users can interact with the widget in three ways:
1.  **Passive Information Consumption:** The primary purpose is for users to quickly view and understand the product's overall rating, the number of reviews, and the distribution of those ratings. This requires no active interaction.
2.  **Visual Feedback and Navigation:** Users receive clear feedback on interactive elements. Hovering over the "Write a product review" button changes its color, and hovering over the "Based on 1,258 reviews" link underlines it, signifying clickability (affordance). Clicking this link would navigate the user down to the detailed reviews section on the same page.
3.  **Initiating an Action:** The main active interaction is clicking the "Write a product review" button. This click is the starting point for a user to contribute their own feedback. This action would typically trigger the appearance of a review submission form, either as a modal overlay or by navigating to a dedicated review page.
