* Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
The shopping cart widget is a 380px wide panel with a clean, modern aesthetic. It uses a professional color palette: a white background for clarity, dark grey text for high readability, and a vibrant blue for the primary "Proceed to Checkout" button to draw the user's attention (affordance and visibility). Secondary actions and text use a lighter grey to create a clear visual hierarchy.

The layout is structured using flexbox for alignment and spacing. A fixed header contains the title "Your Cart" and a close icon. The body lists each product with an image, name, price, and action controls. The footer provides a subtotal summary and the primary checkout button. A key design choice is the inclusion of a "free shipping" progress bar. This gamifies the experience slightly and incentivizes users to increase their order value, which is a common and effective e-commerce strategy. Elements have generous spacing and rounded corners for a soft, approachable feel.

* Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
The appearance of this widget is typically triggered by a user's explicit action: clicking on a shopping cart icon located in the main header of the e-commerce website. This is a universally understood convention, ensuring high predictability and user control. When clicked, the cart slides into view from the top-right corner of the viewport, providing immediate visual feedback that their action was successful. This interaction is designed to be non-disruptive, allowing the user to quickly review their cart without navigating away from their current page, thus supporting efficient task execution. Alternatively, some sites might trigger it to appear automatically for a few seconds after a user adds an item to their cart.

* Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
Users have a comprehensive set of interactions designed for efficient cart management. They can:
1.  **View Cart Contents:** At a glance, users see a summary of all items, including images, names, prices, and the total item count in the header.
2.  **Adjust Quantity:** For each item, users can click "+" or "-" buttons to increment or decrement the quantity. They can also type a specific number directly into the input field, which is constrained to accept only numbers greater than zero.
3.  **Remove an Item:** By clicking a distinct trash can icon next to an item, the user can remove it from the cart entirely. The icon's hover state turns red to give feedback on this destructive action.
4.  **Proceed to Checkout:** The most prominent action is clicking the large, brightly colored "Proceed to Checkout" button, which navigates them to the next step of the purchasing funnel.
5.  **Dismiss the Cart:** Users can click the "X" icon in the header to close the cart and continue browsing the website.
