        Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

        The component is a rectangular banner with rounded corners, designed to float at the top of the page. It features a clean, professional layout. On the left, a vibrant placeholder image (300px wide) adds visual appeal and context. The right side contains the text and form on a white background.

        Colors: The palette is chosen for trust and clarity. The background is white (#FFFFFF), text is a dark gray (#1a1a1a), and the primary call-to-action button is a bright, optimistic blue (#007bff). This high contrast makes the button, the main interactive element, stand out.

        Elements & Layout: A large, bold headline ("Join the Club & Get 15% Off") immediately communicates the core value. The layout uses flexbox to align the image and content side-by-side, which is a modern and efficient structure. On smaller screens, the layout stacks vertically to ensure readability and usability. These choices are made to create a non-intrusive yet persuasive component that looks professional, clearly communicates its purpose, and guides the user toward the intended action.

        Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

        This widget is designed to be triggered by specific user behaviors to maximize relevance and minimize annoyance. The most common trigger would be for a new, first-time visitor. After the user has been on the site for a short period, such as 5-10 seconds, the banner would animate into view from the top. This delay ensures the user has had a moment to engage with the site's content before being presented with an offer.

        Alternatively, it could be triggered by "exit intent," where the component appears when the user's cursor moves towards the browser's address bar or close button, presenting a last-chance offer to retain them. Another trigger could be upon visiting a specific landing page from a marketing campaign. For this implementation, the primary intended trigger is a time-delayed appearance for new users, as it's a balanced approach between being proactive and respecting the user's browsing experience.

        Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
        
        Users have a clear and limited set of interactions, designed for efficiency and to prevent errors.

        1.  **Signing Up (Primary Action):** The user can click the input field, which gets a blue glowing border (focus state) for clear feedback. They can then type their email address. The HTML5 `required` and `type="email"` attributes provide basic validation. Clicking the "Sign Up Now" button provides visual feedback: it darkens on hover and shrinks slightly when clicked (active state). Upon successful submission, a confirmation would typically appear.

        2.  **Dismissing the Widget:** If the user is not interested, they can click the 'Ã—' icon in the top-right corner. The icon is placed in a conventional location for easy discovery. It has a hover state (background darkens) to indicate it's interactive. Clicking it immediately removes the banner from view, allowing the user to continue their browsing journey without interruption.

        3.  **Ignoring the Widget:** The widget is positioned to be visible but not obstructive. Users can simply ignore it and continue to scroll and interact with the main page content beneath it.
