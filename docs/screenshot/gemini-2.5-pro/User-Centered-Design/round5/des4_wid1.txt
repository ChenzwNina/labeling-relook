## Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a clean, responsive grid of product cards against a light grey background. Each card is white with rounded corners and a subtle shadow that intensifies on hover, giving it a tactile, lifted appearance.

**Colors:** The palette is professional and minimalist. The main text is a dark grey (`#2c3e50`). A vibrant blue (`#3498db`) is used for the primary "Add to Cart" button to draw the user's eye to the main action. Prices are in a prominent green (`#27ae60`) to signify value, while sale badges use a contrasting red (`#e74c3c`) for urgency.

**Elements & Layout:** A large header introduces the section. Each card features a high-quality product image at the top, a fixed-height title to maintain grid alignment, the price, and a full-width action button at the bottom. The responsive grid layout (`grid-template-columns`) ensures an optimal viewing experience on any device, from mobile phones to large desktops. These choices create a visually appealing, scannable, and trustworthy interface that prioritizes clarity and efficient user action.

## Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This product list component is not a dynamic widget triggered by a specific user action like clicking a button. Instead, its appearance is triggered by page navigation. It is a core, static component of a larger page within an e-commerce website. A user would see this component upon loading a key page, such as:

*   The **Homepage**, featured in a section like "New Arrivals" or "Best Sellers."
*   A **Category Page** (e.g., "Laptops" or "Headphones"), displaying all products within that category.
*   A **Search Results Page**, showing items that match a user's query.

Its role is to be an integral part of the browsing and discovery experience, presenting products to the user immediately upon entering a relevant section of the site.

## Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several clear and intuitive interaction points designed for an efficient shopping experience:

1.  **Visual Feedback on Hover:** When a user hovers their mouse over a product card, it lifts with an enhanced shadow. This provides immediate feedback that the entire card is an interactive element. The "Add to Cart" button also darkens, signaling its clickability.

2.  **Navigation to Product Details:** The product image and title are wrapped in a link. Clicking either of these elements (indicated by a pointer cursor) would navigate the user to that specific product's detail page for more information.

3.  **Adding to Cart:** Clicking the prominent blue "Add to Cart" button would add the item to the user's shopping cart. The button provides tactile feedback by slightly shrinking when pressed (`active` state).

4.  **Handling Constraints:** For the "Sold Out" item, the card has a reduced opacity and a "Sold Out" overlay. The button is visually disabled (greyed out) and functionally disabled (`disabled` attribute), preventing the user from clicking it. This directly communicates the item's unavailability and prevents a frustrating user error.
