Question 4.1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The product card has a clean, modern design with a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle drop shadow that intensifies on hover. This creates a tangible, "lifted" feel, encouraging interaction.

The layout follows a strong visual hierarchy. A large, square-aspect-ratio image sits at the top, immediately grabbing attention. Below, the product name is large and bold (1.25rem), while the brand name is smaller and lighter, providing context without competing for attention. The sale price is the most prominent text element (1.75rem, bold) to emphasize value, placed next to a struck-through original price.

The color scheme is strategic: a vibrant green for the "Add to Cart" button acts as a clear call-to-action (CTA), leveraging the psychological association of green with "go" or "success." A contrasting red "20% OFF" badge creates urgency. These choices are designed to guide the user’s eye from the visual (image) to value (price) to action (CTA), maximizing conversion rates (Rule 3.2) and sales (Rule 3.1).

Question 4.2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this product card widget is not triggered by a specific user action (like a pop-up) but by user navigation. It is a static component that renders on the page load.

This widget is designed to be a core element of several key page types within an e-commerce site. It would appear when a user lands on a Product Listing Page (PLP), such as a category page (e.g., "Men's Running Shoes"), a brand page (e.g., "All AeroRun Products"), or a search results page. It would also be used on the homepage in curated sections like "New Arrivals," "Best Sellers," or "You Might Also Like."

This immediate visibility upon page load is crucial for minimizing bounce rate (Rule 3.9) by instantly presenting relevant products. It also facilitates browsing and product discovery, thereby increasing page views per visit (Rule 3.6) and time on site (Rule 3.5).

Question 4.3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can have several direct and intuitive interactions with this widget, each designed to serve a different user intent and optimize the shopping funnel.

1.  **Hover:** Moving the cursor over the card provides immediate visual feedback—the card "lifts" with a stronger shadow. This signals interactivity and improves the user experience, encouraging further engagement (Rule 3.5).

2.  **Clicking the Image or Title:** A click on the product image, title, or rating link navigates the user to the full Product Detail Page (PDP). This serves users who require more information (e.g., more images, detailed description, full reviews) before making a decision, thus accommodating a considered purchase path.

3.  **Clicking "Add to Cart":** This is the primary conversion action. Clicking this prominent green button adds the product directly to the shopping cart, often triggering a confirmation via a mini-cart or a subtle notification. This provides a frictionless path to purchase for decisive buyers, which is critical for maximizing conversion (Rule 3.2) and minimizing cart abandonment (Rule 3.8).
