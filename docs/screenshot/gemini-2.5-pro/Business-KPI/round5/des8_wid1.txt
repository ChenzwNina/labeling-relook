4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, modern "flyout" panel positioned in the top-right corner. It features a predominantly white background (#ffffff) with dark gray text (#333) for high readability, using the 'Lato' sans-serif font. The layout is structured vertically: a header with the title and close button, a list of cart items, and a footer with the subtotal and action buttons. 

A key design choice is the bright blue (#e6f7ff) incentive bar with a progress indicator, which visually encourages users to add more items to unlock free shipping, directly aiming to increase the average order size. Product images are a uniform 70x70px to maintain visual consistency. The most important element, the "Secure Checkout" button, is large and rendered in a high-contrast, confident green (#28a745) to draw the user's eye and maximize the conversion rate. These choices are based on established e-commerce UX principles to build trust, create urgency, and guide the user smoothly towards purchase.

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The primary trigger for this widget is a user clicking on the main shopping cart icon, which is typically located in the website's persistent header navigation. This is a standard, user-initiated action that meets customer expectations.

A secondary, proactive trigger can be implemented to enhance the user experience and provide immediate feedback. The widget can be configured to automatically slide into view for a few seconds immediately after a user clicks an "Add to Cart" button on a product page. This confirms the item has been successfully added without navigating away from the current page, which reduces friction and encourages further browsing. After this brief appearance, it would automatically slide back out of view, remaining accessible via the main cart icon. This combination of user-initiated and system-feedback triggers creates a seamless and responsive shopping experience.

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have a comprehensive set of interactions designed for complete cart management without leaving their current page. They can:
1.  **View a summary:** See all items, their images, prices, and the total quantity in the header.
2.  **Adjust quantity:** Increase or decrease the quantity of any item using dedicated "+" and "-" buttons. They can also type a number directly into the input field.
3.  **Remove items:** Click a "Remove" link to delete an item from the cart entirely.
4.  **Proceed to payment:** Click the prominent, green "Secure Checkout" button to navigate to the full checkout process.
5.  **Continue browsing:** Click the "Continue Shopping" link to close the widget and return to the store, encouraging further product discovery.
6.  **Close the widget:** Click the 'X' icon in the header to dismiss the cart view and remain on their current page.
7.  **Monitor progress:** Visually track how close they are to earning free shipping via the incentive progress bar, which updates as the subtotal changes.
