4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The component is a sleek, horizontal banner with rounded corners, positioned at the top of the screen. It features a premium, deep navy blue gradient background (#1D2B4E to #2C3E6E) which creates a sense of exclusivity and value. Text is high-contrast white for maximum readability. The layout, managed by flexbox, places an icon and text on the left and action buttons on the right. 

    The most important element, the "Join for Free" Call-to-Action (CTA) button, is a vibrant green (#28a745). This color is psychologically associated with "go" and positivity, making it stand out to maximize click-through rates (Rule 3.2, 3.4). The headline is bold and slightly larger than the descriptive subtext to quickly convey the main proposition. This clean, organized layout and strategic color choice are designed to be visually appealing, easy to understand in seconds, and built to drive conversions without being obtrusive.
    
    4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The primary trigger for this widget's appearance is on page load for any user who is not logged in or identified as a club member. To enhance user experience and minimize intrusiveness (Rule 3.9), its appearance is delayed by a fraction of a second and includes a smooth `fadeInDown` animation. This prevents a jarring "pop-up" effect. 

    An alternative, more advanced trigger could be based on user engagement, such as when a user scrolls 40% down the page or adds an item to their cart. This strategy targets users who have already shown interest in the products, making the membership offer (with its discounts and free shipping) highly relevant and timed to overcome potential purchase friction like shipping costs, directly impacting cart abandonment rates (Rule 3.8).
    
    4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users have three distinct interaction paths, catering to different levels of interest and intent:

    1.  **Immediate Conversion:** The primary interaction is clicking the vibrant green "Join for Free" CTA button. This is the main conversion path (Rule 3.2) and would typically trigger a sign-up modal overlay or navigate the user directly to a dedicated, streamlined registration page.

    2.  **Information Seeking:** For users who are interested but need more persuasion, clicking the "See All Perks" link provides a secondary path. This action navigates them to a detailed landing page that elaborates on the membership benefits, aiming to increase their engagement and time on site (Rule 3.5).

    3.  **Dismissal:** Users who are not interested can click the "Ã—" close button. This action immediately hides the banner, respecting the user's focus and preventing a negative experience that could lead to a site bounce (Rule 3.9). Ideally, this would set a session cookie to prevent the banner from reappearing, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
