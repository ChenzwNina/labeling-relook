4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, modal-like card centered at the top of the viewport. It uses a professional sans-serif font (Inter) for readability. The layout is a single, clear column to guide the user's eye downwards.

- **Colors**: The primary action to "Keep My Benefits" uses a bright, positive green (`#28a745`) to make it the most appealing choice, psychologically associating it with a "go" or "yes" decision. The special offer is highlighted with a warm, soft yellow (`#fff3cd`) to draw attention without being alarming. The final "Proceed to cancel" option is a muted grey link, making it less visually prominent but still easily accessible. This color strategy aims to maximize retention (Rule 3.2).
- **Size & Layout**: The "Keep My Benefits" button is the largest and most vibrant element in the action area. The headline is large and empathetic to reduce user frustration. Benefits are listed with icons for quick scanning. This visual hierarchy is designed to present the value of staying and the retention offer more forcefully than the option to leave, directly supporting the goal of maximizing revenue and minimizing membership abandonment (Rules 3.1, 3.8).

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget is not a random pop-up. It is triggered when a logged-in member navigates to their account settings and explicitly clicks on a link or button labeled "Manage Membership" and then "Cancel Membership." Its appearance is a direct and expected consequence of the user's intent to cancel. This ensures the experience is not intrusive, which helps minimize bounce rate and user frustration (Rule 3.9). By presenting this retention-focused interface at the critical moment of cancellation, the design attempts to convert a cancellation event into a retention or a pause, maximizing the chances of keeping the customer (Rule 3.2, 3.7).

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have a clear, multi-option path designed to maximize retention while respecting their initial intent.

1.  **Read and Reconsider**: The user first sees a summary of the valuable benefits they are about to lose, prompting them to reconsider their decision.
2.  **Accept Retention Offer**: The most prominent interaction is clicking the large green button to accept the 50% discount. This is the primary "conversion" goal, designed to retain the member and their revenue stream (Rule 3.1).
3.  **Pause Membership**: As a softer alternative, the user can click the "Pause for 3 months" button. This is a valuable middle-ground that prevents outright cancellation, keeping them in the ecosystem and likely to return as a paying member (Rule 3.7).
4.  **Proceed with Cancellation**: For users who are determined to leave, they can click the understated "Proceed to cancel" link at the bottom. This final, de-emphasized option is crucial for good user experience; it prevents trapping the user, which would otherwise lead to frustration and a negative brand perception (Rule 3.9).
