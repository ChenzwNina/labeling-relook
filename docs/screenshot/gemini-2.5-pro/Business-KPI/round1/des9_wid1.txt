4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a responsive, card-style container designed for clarity and trust.
**Layout:** It features a main title and introductory text. Below, shipping options and add-ons are presented in a two-column layout on wider screens, stacking to a single column on smaller devices for optimal viewing. Shipping options utilize radio buttons for single selection, while add-ons use checkboxes for multiple choices. A prominent "Proceed to Payment" CTA button is at the bottom.
**Colors:**
-   Container: White (`#ffffff`) with a subtle shadow, set against a light page background (`#e9eef2`) for a clean, modern aesthetic.
-   Text: Dark gray (`#2c3e50`, `#333`) for high readability.
-   Primary Action/Selection: A vibrant blue (`#007bff`) highlights selected items, interactive element accents, and the main CTA button, guiding user focus.
-   Recommended Badge: Green (`#28a745`) draws attention to the preferred shipping option.
**Element Sizes:**
-   Headings: H2 (`24px`), H3 (`20px`) establish a clear visual hierarchy.
-   Option Text: `14-16px` for easy reading.
-   Interactive Elements: Radio/checkboxes (`18px`) are sufficiently large for easy interaction.
-   CTA Button: Generously padded (`15px 35px`) with bold `18px` text, making it an unmissable focal point.
**Rationale:** These choices create a user-friendly experience. The clean layout and familiar inputs minimize cognitive load. The color scheme builds trust and directs attention to key actions. Visual feedback (hover/selected states) enhances usability. This design prioritizes ease of use and transparency to maximize conversion rates and minimize cart abandonment (Rules 3.2, 3.8), ultimately supporting sales (Rule 3.1).

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget is an integral part of the e-commerce checkout flow, appearing when the user navigates to specific pages rather than being triggered by user inaction (like a pop-up).
Typically, it becomes visible when the user reaches:
1.  **The Cart Page:** After users review their selected items, this widget allows them to choose shipping and optional add-ons before proceeding to payment. It would be a clearly defined section on this page.
2.  **The Checkout Page (Often the first step):** In a multi-step checkout process, this component would commonly form the initial step, dedicated to "Shipping & Delivery Options."
The requirement "positioned at the top of the viewport with a 20-pixel margin" refers to its placement within the main content area of these pages—it's one of the first major elements the user interacts with, having a 20px top margin from the start of the content block or page body. It's not fixed or sticky, but part of the document flow.

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can interact with the widget in several intuitive ways:
1.  **Selecting a Shipping Option:** Users click on a shipping option's container or its radio button. This highlights the chosen option, deselects any previous choice, updates the "Estimated Delivery" display, and enables the "Proceed to Payment" button. Only one shipping option can be active.
2.  **Selecting/Deselecting Add-Ons:** Users click on an add-on's container or its checkbox. This toggles the add-on's selection state (checked/unchecked) and visually highlights/unhighlights the item. Multiple add-ons can be chosen independently.
3.  **Hovering over Options:** Mousing over selectable shipping options or add-on items provides visual feedback (e.g., background color change, border emphasis), indicating interactivity and improving discoverability.
4.  **Clicking the Call-to-Action (CTA) Button:** Once a shipping option is selected, the "Proceed to Payment" button becomes active. Clicking it submits the choices and navigates the user to the next checkout step (e.g., payment details).
5.  **Viewing Information:** Users read descriptions, prices, and see visual cues like the add-on image or the "Recommended" badge. They also see contextual information like a "Free Shipping" banner based on their cart subtotal.
These interactions are designed for clarity and ease, guiding users efficiently through this stage of purchase, which helps reduce cart abandonment and improve conversion rates.
