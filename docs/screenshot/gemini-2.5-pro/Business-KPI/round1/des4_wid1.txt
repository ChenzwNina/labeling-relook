4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The widget is a full-width section fixed 20px from the top of the viewport. Inside, a content area with a maximum width of 1200px is centered, featuring a clean white background (#ffffff) and rounded corners, set against the page's light grey (#e9eef2). This creates a modern, floating panel effect.
    The title, "Discover Our Latest Collection," is large (2em), bold, and uses a dark color (#1a2533) with the 'Roboto' font for impact and clarity, aiming to draw users in (Rule 3.7).
    Products are displayed in a responsive grid (using CSS Grid `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(270px, 1fr))`), ensuring optimal viewing on various screen sizes. Each product card has a white background, subtle border (#e0e0e0), and rounded corners. On hover, cards lift slightly with an increased shadow, providing interactive feedback (Rule 3.5).
    Product images are 200px high, using `object-fit: cover` for consistency. Product names ('Roboto', 1.25em, #2c3e50) and descriptions (0.9em, #555) are concise, with line clamping to maintain a uniform look.
    Prices are prominent (1.5em, 'Roboto', #e74c3c - red for attention), with optional strikethrough old prices to highlight savings (Rule 3.1). Star ratings (gold, #f39c12) and review counts provide social proof (Rule 3.2).
    Call-to-action buttons ("Add to Cart" - vibrant green #27ae60; "View Details" - light grey #ecf0f1) are distinct, full-width within their action area, and clear, guiding users towards conversion (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.6). Badges like "NEW" (red) or "BESTSELLER" (orange) further attract attention to specific items.
    The overall design uses a professional, clean aesthetic with a high-contrast color palette to maximize readability, trust, and conversion rates. Spacing and typography choices are made to ensure a pleasant, uncluttered user experience, reducing bounce rate (Rule 3.9).

    4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    This widget is designed to be a persistent element on the page. It appears as soon as the page loads, typically as a featured section on a homepage, a category page, or a dedicated "New Arrivals" or "Promotions" page. It's not triggered by a user action like a click or scroll (in terms of appearing dynamically like a modal), but rather it's an integral part of the page layout, fixed at the top 20px from the viewport. This ensures high visibility for the showcased products, aiming to capture user attention immediately and drive engagement from the moment they land on the page (Rules 3.1, 3.4, 3.7). Its fixed position keeps these key products in view, even as the user might scroll content below it, reinforcing their presence.

    4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users can engage with the widget in several ways:
    1.  **Visual Scanning:** Users can quickly scan the grid of products, absorbing information from images, titles, prices, and badges.
    2.  **Hover Interaction:** Hovering over a product card provides visual feedback (a slight lift and enhanced shadow), indicating it's an interactive element and making the interface feel more responsive.
    3.  **Clicking "Add to Cart":** Users can click the prominent "Add to Cart" button. In a live e-commerce site, this would typically add the item to their shopping cart, possibly updating a mini-cart icon or providing a brief confirmation message. This is a primary conversion action (Rule 3.2).
    4.  **Clicking "View Details":** Users can click the "View Details" button (or potentially the product image/name, though not explicitly linked in this static example but common practice). This would navigate them to the individual product detail page for more comprehensive information, images, and purchase options (Rule 3.6).
    5.  **Reading Reviews (Implicit):** The star rating and review count prompt users to consider social proof, influencing their purchasing decision even if they don't click to read full reviews immediately.
    No direct manipulation (like sorting or filtering) is built into this specific component, as it's focused on displaying a curated list.
