4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component features a clean, modern grid layout under a prominent header "This Season's Staff Picks". The color palette is primarily neutral (white cards on a soft gray `#F8F9FA` background) to feel calm and premium. Key actions use specific, vibrant colors: the "Add to Cart" button is a decisive green (`#28a745`) to signal a positive action and increase conversions. A warm orange (`#E85D04`) badge for "BEST SELLER" creates urgency and social proof. Text is large and highly readable using the 'Inter' font. Product cards use generous whitespace and a subtle shadow, lifting off the page on hover to provide satisfying feedback and encourage clicks. This entire design is structured to build trust, reduce friction, and guide the user towards making a purchase, directly supporting sales and conversion rate goals.

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is not triggered by a specific user action like a click or scroll. Instead, it's a static, core component designed to be an integral part of high-traffic pages, such as the website's homepage or main category landing pages. It loads instantly with the page, positioned near the top of the viewport. This immediate visibility is intentional to minimize bounce rate by capturing the user's interest right away with attractive, curated products. Its purpose is to drive product discovery and engagement from the moment a visitor arrives, maximizing their time on site and encouraging page views.

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can have several interactions designed to drive engagement and sales.
1.  **Hover**: Moving the cursor over a product card makes it lift and gain a stronger shadow, providing visual feedback and indicating it's an interactive element.
2.  **Product Discovery Click**: Clicking on the product image, name, or category text navigates the user to that specific product's detail page. This encourages deeper engagement and increases page views.
3.  **Direct Purchase Click**: Clicking the green "Add to Cart" button adds the item directly to the user's shopping cart, streamlining the purchase process for decisive buyers and aiming to increase conversion rates.
4.  **Explore More Click**: Clicking the "View All Products â†’" link in the header takes the user to a full gallery or category page of all featured items, catering to users who want to browse more options and increasing average order size potential.
