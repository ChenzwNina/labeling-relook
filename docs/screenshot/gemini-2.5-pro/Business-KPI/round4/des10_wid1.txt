Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
The component is a sleek, horizontal banner positioned at the top of the viewport. It features a dark charcoal background (#1a202c) with crisp white text, creating a premium, high-contrast look that is easy to read. A gold star icon and a vibrant gold Call-To-Action (CTA) button (#f6c90e) immediately draw the user's eye to the key benefits and the primary action. The layout uses flexbox to neatly align the descriptive text on the left and the action buttons on the right, ensuring a balanced and uncluttered appearance. These color and layout choices are designed to feel exclusive and valuable, encouraging sign-ups (maximizing conversion) while the non-intrusive banner format avoids disrupting the user journey (minimizing bounce rate).

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
This widget is triggered on page load for any user who is not currently logged in as a site member. It would appear on high-traffic, strategic pages such as the homepage, category pages, and product detail pages. Displaying it to new or unauthenticated visitors ensures that the value proposition of the membership is presented to the most relevant audience without annoying existing members. To enhance user experience, its appearance is animated with a subtle slide-down effect, drawing attention without being jarring. A cookie would be set upon closing the banner to prevent it from reappearing for a set period, respecting the user's choice.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
Users have three primary interactions with the widget. First, the main conversion action is clicking the "Unlock My Benefits" CTA button. This would navigate them to a dedicated membership signup page or open a registration modal, moving them down the conversion funnel. Second, users can click the '×' close button to dismiss the banner, which removes it from view for their current session and potentially for several days. This provides user control and minimizes annoyance (reducing bounce rate). Third, both the CTA and close buttons have hover effects—the CTA brightens and lifts slightly, and the close icon becomes brighter—providing clear visual feedback that these elements are interactive and clickable.
