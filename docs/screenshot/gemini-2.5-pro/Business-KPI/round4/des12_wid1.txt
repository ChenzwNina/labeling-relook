4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a large, two-column modal dialog that appears at the top of the page. 
- **Layout**: On the left, a visually appealing section with an image of a happy shopper and a list of membership benefits. On the right, the account creation form. This layout uses the "value proposition + action" pattern; it first convinces the user *why* they should sign up before asking them *to* sign up, which boosts conversion (Rule 3.2). 
- **Colors**: The primary call-to-action (CTA) button is a vibrant green (#28a745) to create high contrast against the neutral white background, drawing the user's eye and encouraging clicks (Rule 3.4). The focused input fields get a blue glow (#007bff), providing clear user feedback. The overall palette is clean and professional to build trust.
- **Size**: The form elements—inputs and buttons—are large and have ample padding, making them easy to interact with on both desktop and mobile. The headline text is large and bold to immediately grab attention. This user-friendly sizing minimizes user friction and potential frustration, which helps reduce bounce rates (Rule 3.9).

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by specific user behaviors indicating engagement or intent, rather than appearing immediately on page load, which would be intrusive and increase bounce rate (violating Rule 3.9). Ideal triggers include:
1.  **Action-Based Trigger**: The most effective trigger. The modal appears after a user attempts a members-only action, such as clicking "Add to Wishlist" or "Save for Later" without being logged in. This provides a solution at the exact moment of need.
2.  **Exit-Intent Trigger**: When the user’s cursor moves towards the browser's close or back button. This is a non-disruptive attempt to retain a visitor who is about to leave, offering an incentive (15% off) to stay and convert (Rules 3.2, 3.7).
3.  **Scroll-Depth Trigger**: The widget can appear after a user has scrolled through a significant portion of a product or category page (e.g., 60%), which signals high interest. This is less intrusive than a time-based trigger and targets already engaged users.

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several clear interaction paths designed to maximize conversion and minimize friction.
1.  **Primary Path (Email Signup)**: The user can type their email and a new password into the input fields and click the main green CTA button, "Create Account & Get 15% Off," to register.
2.  **Secondary Path (Social Login)**: For faster signup, the user can click the "Google" or "Facebook" buttons. This bypasses the manual form, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and thus increasing conversion rates (Rule 3.2).
3.  **Dismissal**: If the user is not interested, they can click the '×' icon in the top-right corner to close the modal and continue their browsing session uninterrupted. This is a critical feature to prevent user frustration and minimize bounce rate (Rule 3.9).
4.  **Alternative Path (Log In)**: If the user realizes they already have an account, they can click the "Log In" link. This would typically close the signup widget and open a separate login widget, preventing user error and frustration.
