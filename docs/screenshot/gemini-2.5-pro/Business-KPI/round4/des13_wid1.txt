4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The component is a clean, centered card with a white background and rounded corners, creating a modern and focused user interface. It is elevated by a subtle shadow, making it stand out against the page content. 
    
    The layout is a single column, guiding the user's eye from the clear "Sign In" heading, to the benefit-oriented subtitle ("Access your orders..."), through the input fields, and down to the primary action button. The primary "Sign In" button uses a vibrant, trustworthy blue (#007aff) to draw attention and encourage clicks, directly supporting conversion rate optimization. Input fields have generous padding and a noticeable blue focus state, enhancing usability. Text is a dark gray (#1c1c1e) on a white background for maximum readability, and a clean sans-serif font ('Lato') is used for a professional feel. These choices create a frictionless, trustworthy, and visually appealing experience designed to minimize user hesitation and maximize successful sign-ins.
    
    4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
    
    The appearance of this widget is triggered by an explicit user action. It is designed to appear when a user clicks on a "Sign In" or "My Account" link, which is typically located in the main header navigation of the e-commerce website. 
    
    This user-initiated approach is crucial for a positive user experience. It ensures the widget is not an unwelcome interruption but a direct response to the user's expressed intent. This method avoids the intrusiveness of an automatic popup, which could frustrate users and increase the bounce rate. By appearing only when requested, the component helps facilitate the user's journey smoothly, keeping them on their current page (if implemented as a modal) and moving them closer to conversion goals like completing a purchase or managing their account.

    4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users have a clear and focused set of interactions designed for efficiency. First, they can click into the "Email Address" and "Password" input fields to type their credentials. The fields provide visual feedback by highlighting with a blue glow when active (on focus). The password field masks the input for security. 
    
    Next, users can click the primary blue "Sign In" button to submit their details and log in. If they've forgotten their credentials, they can click the "Forgot your password?" link, which would navigate them to a password reset flow. Finally, if they are a new user, they can click the "Create an account" link at the bottom, which directs them to the registration page. Each interaction is distinct, clearly labeled, and supports the primary goal of getting the user logged in or directing them to the correct alternative path, minimizing abandonment.
