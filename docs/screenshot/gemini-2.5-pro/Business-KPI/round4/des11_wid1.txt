4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a clean, modern card centered at the top of the viewport. It uses a soft white background with a subtle shadow to float above the main page content, grabbing the user's focus. The layout is structured to guide the user's eye downward.

- **Colors:** The primary color palette is calm and professional. A friendly purple (`#6c63ff`) is used for benefit icons and one of the offer buttons, creating a positive association. The most important positive action, "Keep My Membership," uses a prominent, reassuring green (`#27ae60`) to signify a 'go' or 'safe' choice. The final cancellation action is a muted gray text link, intentionally de-emphasized to be the least visually appealing option, thus discouraging clicks.

- **Size & Layout:** The main headline is large and bold to immediately convey the context. The widget then presents a clear "loss aversion" section listing the benefits the user will lose, using icons for quick scanning. Below this, two equally-sized "retention offer" cards present attractive alternatives to cancellation. The most visually dominant element is the large, green "Keep My Membership" button, making it the easiest and most appealing path for the user. This visual hierarchy is designed to maximize retention and revenue by making cancellation the path of most resistance.

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by a direct and explicit user action. On the user's "Account" or "Membership" page within the e-commerce site, there will be a button or link labeled "Cancel Membership." When the user clicks this button, instead of being taken to a final confirmation page, this modal widget appears as an overlay on the current page. This design acts as an "exit-intent intervention" specific to the membership feature. It intercepts the user's cancellation action to present them with compelling reasons and alternative offers to stay, directly addressing the goal of minimizing membership churn and preserving recurring revenue.

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have five distinct interaction paths, designed to steer them away from cancellation:

1.  **Review Benefits:** The user can read the list of benefits they are about to lose. This is a passive interaction designed to create hesitation and reinforce the value of the membership.

2.  **Accept Pause Offer:** The user can click the "Pause for 3 Months" button. This would likely close the widget and show a success message confirming the pause, retaining the user in the ecosystem without immediate cancellation.

3.  **Accept Discount Offer:** The user can click the "Get 50% Off Now" button. This action would apply the discount to their account, close the widget, and confirm their continued membership at the new rate, directly saving the sale.

4.  **Keep Membership:** The user can click the large, green "No, I'll Keep My Membership!" button. This is the primary "escape hatch" that cancels the cancellation process. It would simply close the widget, leaving the user on their account page with their membership intact.

5.  **Proceed to Cancel:** After weighing the benefits and offers, the user can click the understated "proceed with cancellation" link at the very bottom. This is the final, least desirable path, which would likely lead to another, simpler confirmation step to complete the process.
