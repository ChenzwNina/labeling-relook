**4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?**

The widget is a horizontal banner fixed 20px from the top of the viewport. It has a deep teal background (`#004D40`) with white text (`#FFFFFF`) for excellent readability and a premium feel. The Call-to-Action (CTA) button, "Unlock My Perks," is a vibrant amber/yellow (`#FFC107`) with dark blue text, designed to stand out and encourage clicks. A subtle white '×' serves as the close button.

The headline ("Join Our Exclusive Club & Instantly Save 15%!") is prominent (20px font, bold), followed by smaller descriptive text (14px) detailing further benefits like free shipping and early access. The layout uses flexbox, placing text on the left/center and the CTA button to the right for a clear visual flow on wider screens. On mobile, it stacks vertically for better readability.

These choices are made to maximize impact and conversion. The teal and white create trust and clarity. The contrasting CTA draws immediate attention to the primary action (Rule 3.2). The fixed position ensures constant visibility (Rule 3.5), while the clear value proposition (discounts, free shipping) aims to boost sign-ups, leading to increased sales and AOV (Rules 3.1, 3.3). The dismiss option respects user choice, minimizing potential frustration (Rule 3.9). Rounded corners and a slight shadow give it a modern, integrated feel.

**4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?**

This membership signup widget is primarily designed to appear automatically for new visitors or users who are not logged into an existing member account. The most common trigger would be **on page load** for these user segments. This strategy ensures immediate visibility of the membership offer, aiming to convert new users early in their journey (Rule 3.7).

To avoid user fatigue, its appearance could be controlled by session logic. For instance, if a user dismisses it, a cookie or localStorage item could prevent it from reappearing for a set duration (e.g., current session or 24 hours). For this HTML/CSS-only component, the trigger is effectively "always visible upon page load" unless JavaScript is added to manage these more sophisticated display conditions or dismissal persistence.

**4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?**

Users have three main types of interactions with this widget:

1.  **Positive Engagement (Conversion Path)**:
    *   **Read the Offer**: Users see the banner, read the headline ("Join Our Exclusive Club & Instantly Save 15%!") and the supporting text ("Unlock free shipping...").
    *   **Click CTA**: They click the "Unlock My Perks" button. This action is intended to navigate them to a dedicated membership signup page or open a registration form/modal (this specific HTML links to `#signup`). This is the primary desired interaction, aiming to maximize membership sign-ups (Rule 3.2).

2.  **Dismissal**:
    *   **Click Close Button**: Users can click the '×' button on the right. This is intended to hide the banner. While the HTML/CSS provides the button, JavaScript would be needed to implement the actual hide functionality and potentially remember the dismissal. This respects user preference and helps minimize bounce if the offer isn't relevant at that moment (Rule 3.9).

3.  **Passive Interaction (Ignoring)**:
    *   **No Direct Action**: Users might see the banner but choose not to interact directly, continuing to browse the site. The banner remains visible due to its fixed position, subtly reinforcing the membership benefits and potentially leading to a later conversion (Rules 3.5, 3.7).
