4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a rectangular card with rounded corners, a soft white background (#ffffff), and a subtle box shadow for a modern, elevated appearance. It's centered at the top of the viewport with a 20px top margin.
The layout is single-column for easy readability.
    - **Heading ("Thinking of Leaving Our StyleClub?"):** Prominent (24px), dark grey (#343a40), and bold to clearly state the purpose.
    - **Informative Text:** Uses a slightly smaller font size (16px) in a softer dark grey (#495057) for readability.
    - **Benefits List:** Items are preceded by green checkmarks (âœ“) for visual appeal and to quickly convey value. This directly addresses retaining the user by highlighting what they'll lose (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.3).
    - **Action Buttons:**
        - "No, Keep My StyleClub Benefits": Styled as a primary button with a solid blue background (#007bff) and white text. It's designed to be more visually inviting to encourage retention (Rules 3.1, 3.2). On wider screens, it's positioned to the right, a common placement for the preferred action.
        - "Yes, Cancel My Membership": Styled as a secondary/warning button with a transparent background, red text (#dc3545), and a red border. This makes the cancellation option clear but less visually dominant than the retain option, a subtle nudge towards retention.
    - **Support Link:** A smaller, centered text link below the buttons offers an alternative (pausing, help), further aiming to reduce churn (Rule 3.8).
These choices aim for a clean, professional look common in e-commerce, prioritizing user understanding while strategically guiding them towards retention to support business goals like maximizing revenue and minimizing churn.

4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget would typically appear when a user, who is logged into their e-commerce account, navigates to their "Account Settings," "Subscription Management," or "Membership Details" page and clicks on a specific link or button explicitly labeled "Cancel Membership" or "Manage Subscription" followed by a cancel option. The widget itself is the interface for the cancellation confirmation step. It's not a pop-up triggered by unrelated user behavior (like inactivity or exit intent in this specific design); it's a direct response to the user actively initiating the cancellation process for their "StyleClub Premium" membership. This ensures the user has clear intent, and the widget provides a focused environment for their decision, along with a final opportunity for retention.

4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can have the following interactions with the "Cancel Membership" widget:
1.  **Read Information:** They can read the heading, the introductory text acknowledging their intent, and the list of "StyleClub Premium" benefits they will lose upon cancellation. This information is designed to make them reconsider (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.5).
2.  **Click "No, Keep My StyleClub Benefits":** If the user decides not to cancel, clicking this primary blue button would typically close the widget (or redirect them away from the cancellation flow), effectively ending the cancellation process and retaining them as a member. This directly supports revenue and retention goals.
3.  **Click "Yes, Cancel My Membership":** If the user confirms their decision to cancel, clicking this red-outlined button would proceed with the membership cancellation. This might lead to a final confirmation message, information about when their benefits will end, or an optional feedback form.
4.  **Click "Talk to Our Support Team" Link:** Users can click this link if they have questions, wish to explore alternatives like pausing their membership, or need assistance. This interaction provides an alternative path to outright cancellation, potentially retaining the customer or gathering valuable feedback (Rules 3.5, 3.8).
5.  **Ignore/Close (Implicit):** While not an explicit button, a user might navigate away from the page or close the browser tab. However, the widget is designed to be modal or a focused page section, making this less likely without first interacting with one of the explicit options.
