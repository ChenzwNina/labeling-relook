## Question 4.1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a rectangular container with rounded corners, fixed at the top-center of the viewport with a 20px top margin. It has a clean, modern aesthetic.

**Layout:**
A clear header introduces the section. Below this, "Shipping Options" and "Optional Add-ons" are presented in two columns on wider screens (for easy comparison) and stack vertically on smaller screens (for mobile usability). Each option within these sections is a distinct, clickable card. A prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) button is centered in the footer.

**Colors:**
-   **Background:** Widget background is `#ffffff` (white) for clarity, set against a page background of `#f0f2f5` (light grey). Option cards have a `#f9f9f9` background within their sections.
-   **Text:** `#333333` (dark grey) for headings and primary content, `#555555` (medium grey) for meta descriptions.
-   **Accents & Interactivity:**
    -   `#007bff` (vibrant blue) is used for borders of hovered/focused options, custom radio/checkbox controls when selected, and some badges. This provides clear visual feedback and establishes trust.
    -   `#28a745` (green) is used for the main "Proceed to Payment" CTA button and the "Eco Choice" badge, signifying positive action and progression.
    -   Badges also use light pastel backgrounds with corresponding darker text/border colors for emphasis (e.g., light orange for "Fastest").

**Size of Elements:**
-   The overall widget is `max-width: 800px` to maintain readability but is responsive.
-   Headings (`h2`, `h3`) are appropriately sized for hierarchy.
-   Option cards are well-padded (`15px` inside label) for easy tapping/clicking.
-   The CTA button is large and visually distinct. Font sizes are legible (e.g., base `1em`, `0.9em` for meta). Custom controls are `20x20px`.

**Design Choices Rationale:**
These choices aim to maximize e-commerce goals:
-   **Clarity & Trust (Conversion, Minimize Abandonment):** The clean layout, distinct sections, clear typography, and professional color scheme build trust and make options easy to understand.
-   **Encourage Upselling (Revenue, Order Size):** Add-ons are prominently displayed alongside shipping, with benefit-oriented descriptions and clear pricing. Badges like "Popular" or "Fastest" guide choices.
-   **Ease of Use (User Experience, Minimize Bounce):** Responsive design, large clickable targets, and visual feedback (hover, focus, selected states using custom controls and the `:has()` pseudo-class where supported) enhance usability. The pre-selected "Standard Delivery" reduces friction. The green CTA draws the eye and encourages completion of the purchase.
-   **Brand Perception:** A polished, user-friendly interface like this contributes positively to brand perception, encouraging repeat visits.

## Question 4.2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget is designed to appear at a critical juncture in the e-commerce checkout process. Common triggers would be:

1.  **Transition to Checkout:** After a user reviews their cart and clicks a button like "Proceed to Checkout" or "Secure Checkout." The widget could be the primary content of the first step of a multi-page checkout flow, or slide/fade in over the page.
2.  **Integrated into Cart/Checkout Page:** It could be a dedicated section on the cart review page or an early stage of a single-page checkout, typically appearing once the user has confirmed their cart items and is ready to specify delivery details.
3.  **Address Confirmation:** In some flows, after the user enters or confirms their shipping address, this widget would appear, dynamically populating shipping options and costs relevant to that address.

Given its fixed position at the top of the viewport and its comprehensive nature (shipping and add-ons), it's most likely triggered as a distinct step or prominent section when the user explicitly moves towards finalizing their order and making payment. It's intended to be a focused interaction point before payment details are requested.

## Question 4.3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can engage with the widget in the following ways:

1.  **Review Options:** Users can read the titles, descriptions (meta text), estimated delivery times, and prices for each shipping method and optional add-on. Badges provide quick visual cues (e.g., "Popular," "Fastest," "Eco Choice").
2.  **Select Shipping Method:** Users click on one of the shipping option cards. Since these use radio button logic, selecting one automatically deselects any other. The chosen option is visually distinguished by the state of its custom radio control and a changed border style (if `:has()` is supported, otherwise through focus/hover). One option ("Standard Delivery") is pre-selected.
3.  **Choose Add-ons:** Users can click on any of the optional add-on cards. These use checkbox logic, so multiple add-ons can be selected or deselected independently. Selected add-ons are indicated by their custom checkbox control state and potentially a border change.
4.  **Hover Feedback:** Hovering the mouse cursor over any selectable option card (shipping or add-on) changes its border color and may add a subtle shadow, signaling interactivity.
5.  **Focus Feedback:** Tabbing through options or clicking on them will trigger focus states, typically highlighting the border of the focused option card for accessibility.
6.  **Proceed with Purchase:** Users click the "Proceed to Payment" button. This action would typically validate their selections, update the order total to reflect chosen shipping and add-ons, and then navigate them to the next step in the checkout process (usually payment information).
7.  **Implicit Interaction (Mobile):** On smaller screens, users may scroll within the widget if the content exceeds the viewport height, although the design attempts to fit common scenarios.
There is no explicit "dismiss" or "close" interaction designed for this component, as it's intended to be a mandatory step in the checkout flow.
