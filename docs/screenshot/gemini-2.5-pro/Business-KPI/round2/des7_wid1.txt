4.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The user ratings widget is a horizontal banner fixed at the top of the viewport, with a 20px margin from the very top edge. It spans the full width of the screen.
    Layout: The content within the banner (stars, rating text, review count, and a call-to-action button) is arranged linearly from left to right on wider screens, typically centered within a max-width container. On smaller screens (e.g., mobile), the elements stack vertically to maintain readability. Flexbox is used for alignment and spacing.
    Colors:
    - Banner Background: Clean white (`#ffffff`) for a modern, unobtrusive feel, with a subtle bottom border (`#e0e0e0`) and a soft shadow for depth.
    - Stars: Bright gold (`#FFC107`), universally recognized for high ratings. Five unicode stars (★) are displayed.
    - Text: Primary text is dark grey (`#333333`) for strong readability. Key figures like the rating ("4.9/5") and review count ("15,200+") are bolded (`#000000`) for emphasis. The link within the review count is standard blue (`#007bff`).
    - CTA Button: A vibrant primary blue (`#007bff`) with white text, making it prominent and inviting clicks.
    Element Sizes:
    - Banner Height: Approximately 60-70px on desktop, adjusting for content on mobile.
    - Stars: Around 20px.
    - Text: Main text is ~15px, review count text ~14px.
    - CTA Button: Standard button size with clear text, padding of `10px 18px`.

    Design Choices Rationale:
    The white background and clean lines aim for a professional, trustworthy appearance that integrates well with modern e-commerce sites. Gold stars and bolded high numbers immediately convey positive social proof, crucial for maximizing sales and conversion (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.8). The clear, action-oriented blue CTA encourages users to engage further ("See What Our Shoppers Say!"), aiming to increase time on site and page views (Rules 3.5, 3.6). The responsive design ensures a good user experience across devices, minimizing bounce rates (Rule 3.9). The overall design is intended to be reassuring and confidence-building without being intrusive.

    4.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The widget appears automatically as soon as the webpage loads. It is a `position: fixed` element, meaning it's part of the initial page render and remains persistently visible at the top of the viewport (with a 20px margin from the top edge of the browser window) as the user scrolls down the page. No specific user action, such as scrolling to a certain point or clicking an element, is required to trigger its appearance. This constant visibility ensures that the social proof and trust signal it provides are always accessible to the user throughout their browsing session, from landing on the page to making a purchase decision.

    4.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users can have the following interactions with the widget:
    1.  **Visual Consumption & Trust Building (Passive Interaction):** Users will see the star rating (e.g., five gold stars), the numerical score ("4.9 / 5 stars"), and the high volume of reviews ("15,200+ Happy Customer Reviews"). This visual information serves as immediate social proof, building trust and positively influencing their perception of the brand and its products.
    2.  **Clicking the Call-to-Action (CTA) Button:** The primary active interaction is clicking the "See What Our Shoppers Say!" button. This action is designed to navigate the user to a dedicated page on the e-commerce site where they can read detailed customer reviews, testimonials, or see a more comprehensive breakdown of ratings. This interaction aims to deepen engagement.
    3.  **Clicking the Review Count Link:** The text "15,200+ Happy Customer Reviews" also contains a link. Clicking this would typically lead to the same detailed reviews page as the main CTA button, providing another pathway for users to explore customer feedback.
    4.  **Hover Effects:** Both the CTA button and the review count link will exhibit visual feedback on mouse hover (e.g., the CTA button's background color might darken, and the link might show an underline). This indicates interactivity and improves user experience.
    There is no functionality to dismiss or close this widget, as its purpose is to be a persistent positive signal reinforcing trust.
