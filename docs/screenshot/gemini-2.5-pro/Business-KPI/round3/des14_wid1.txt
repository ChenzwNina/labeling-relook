    Question 4.1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The widget is a clean, rectangular card with rounded corners, centered at the top of the viewport. It has a white background with a subtle shadow to lift it off the page. The layout is structured hierarchically. At the top, a bold header "Your Order is On Its Way!" grabs attention, paired with the order number. The most crucial information, the "Estimated Delivery" date, is prominent and colored in a reassuring green (#28a745) to create positive anticipation.

    A visual progress bar provides an at-a-glance status using icons and labels. Completed steps are solid green, the active step is highlighted with a brand-aligned blue (#007bff), and future steps are gray. This color-coding makes the status instantly understandable. Below this, a section with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) lists detailed updates.

    These choices build trust and reduce anxiety. The professional, clean design and use of color psychology (green for success, blue for trust) create a positive post-purchase experience, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business (Rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.7). The clear layout minimizes confusion, reducing the likelihood of users contacting support (minimizing operational cost).

    Question 4.2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    The appearance of this widget is proactively triggered for a logged-in user when they visit any key page of the website (like the homepage or their account page) after their order status has been updated to "Shipped".

    Technically, upon page load, the system would check two conditions:
    1. Is the user authenticated (logged in)?
    2. Does the user have a recent order with an active, shippable status (e.g., 'shipped', 'out_for_delivery')?

    If both conditions are met, and the user hasn't already dismissed the tracker in their current session, the widget appears automatically. This proactive approach delights the customer by providing valuable information without them needing to actively search for it. This enhances the user experience, making them feel valued and well-informed, which is crucial for building brand loyalty and encouraging return visits (Rule 3.7). It also reduces bounce rate by immediately engaging the user with relevant, personalized content (Rule 3.9).

    Question 4.3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users have several intuitive interactions designed for both information consumption and re-engagement:

    1.  **Passive Viewing:** The primary interaction is simply viewing the clear, at-a-glance information. The visual progress bar, bold ETA, and list of live updates allow users to quickly understand their order's status, satisfying their main intent.

    2.  **Dismissal:** Users can click the 'Ã—' icon at the top right to close the widget, giving them full control over their browsing experience. This prevents the widget from being intrusive.

    3.  **Engagement with CTA:** The widget includes a cross-sell section with a discount code ("WELCOMEBACK15"). While the code itself is text, its presentation encourages users to copy it and immediately consider their next purchase, directly addressing rules for maximizing revenue and conversion (Rules 3.1, 3.2).

    4.  **Product Discovery:** The cross-sell section also features a recommended product image. While not a link in this static example, in a real implementation, this image and its title would link directly to a product page, encouraging further browsing, increasing page views per visit, and potentially increasing the average order size on a future purchase (Rules 3.3, 3.6).
