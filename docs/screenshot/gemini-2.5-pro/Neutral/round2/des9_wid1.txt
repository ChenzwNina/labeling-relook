## 3.1 Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

    The widget is a rectangular, modal-like container with rounded corners (10px) and a soft box shadow, giving it a modern, elevated appearance against the page background. It's positioned 20px from the top of the viewport and centered horizontally.

    **Colors:**
    *   Background: Clean white (#ffffff) for the main card.
    *   Text: Uses a hierarchy of dark blue-greys for titles (#2c3e50, #34495e) and text (#3f5161, #5a6a78), ensuring high readability.
    *   Prices: A distinct green (#1a9657) to associate with value and positivity.
    *   Interactive Elements: Radio buttons and checkboxes use a primary blue (`accent-color: #007bff`) for their selected state. The main call-to-action button is a vibrant green (#28a745).
    *   Borders/Separators: Subtle light greys (#dee2e6, #ecf0f1, #f1f3f5) for structure without visual clutter.

    **Size of Elements:**
    *   Overall dimensions: Max-width of 580px, responsive via `width: 90%`.
    *   Typography: Main title (H2) is ~1.7em, section titles (H3) ~1.3em. Option text is around 0.98em, with strong tags slightly larger and small descriptive text smaller, creating clear visual hierarchy.
    *   Inputs: Radio/checkboxes are scaled (1.15x) for easier tapping/clicking.
    *   Button: Prominently sized with ample padding and 1.15em font size.

    **Layout:**
    *   The overall layout is a single column with clear sections for "Shipping Method" and "Optional Order Enhancements."
    *   Each option within these sections uses a flexbox layout: input (radio/checkbox) on the left, then a block for option details (title and sub-description stacked vertically), and finally the price aligned to the far right. This is a common and scannable pattern for e-commerce choices.
    *   Generous padding and margins are used throughout for spacing and visual separation.

    **Design Choices Rationale:**
    These choices aim for a clean, user-friendly, and trustworthy interface, typical of modern e-commerce sites. The color palette emphasizes readability and clear calls to action. The layout prioritizes scannability and ease of selection. Rounded corners and shadows provide a soft, contemporary feel. Responsiveness ensures usability across device sizes.

    ## 3.2 Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

    This widget is typically triggered during the checkout process on an e-commerce website. Common scenarios for its appearance include:
    1.  **Advancing from the Cart:** After a user reviews their shopping cart and clicks a button like "Proceed to Checkout" or "Enter Shipping Details."
    2.  **After Address Entry:** Once the user has submitted their shipping address, as shipping options and costs can be location-dependent. This widget would then allow them to choose from available services for that address.
    3.  **Dedicated Checkout Step:** In a multi-step checkout flow (e.g., Cart -> Address -> Shipping -> Payment), this widget would constitute the "Shipping" step.
    4.  **Modal Trigger:** It could also appear as a modal overlay if the user clicks a specific link or button on the cart/checkout page like "Change Shipping Options" or if these selections are mandatory and haven't been made yet.

    The most common trigger is moving to the stage where shipping details need to be confirmed before payment.

    ## 3.3 Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

    Users can interact with the widget in the following ways:

    1.  **View Information:** Users can read the available shipping methods and optional add-ons, including their names, descriptive details (like delivery times or what's included), and associated costs.
    2.  **Select Shipping Method:** They can click on a radio button or the associated option text/area for a shipping method. Only one shipping method can be active at a time; selecting a new one deselects any previous choice. The `checked` state is visually indicated.
    3.  **Select/Deselect Add-ons:** Users can click on a checkbox or its associated option text/area for an add-on. Multiple add-ons can be selected independently. Clicking a selected checkbox will deselect it. The `checked` state is visually indicated.
    4.  **Hover Feedback:** Hovering over selectable options (the entire `.option` div) provides a subtle background color change, and hovering over the call-to-action button changes its background color and shadow, indicating interactivity.
    5.  **Confirm Choices:** Users click the "Confirm & Continue to Payment" button. This action typically finalizes their shipping and add-on selections, updates the order total (which would be handled by JavaScript/backend), and navigates them to the next step in the checkout, usually payment.
    6.  **No Direct Close (in this design):** As designed, there's no explicit "close" or "cancel" button on the widget itself, implying it's a mandatory step in a flow. If it were a true modal overlay for optional changes, a close icon/button would typically be present.
