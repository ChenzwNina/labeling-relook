## Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a product card with a clean, modern aesthetic, designed for e-commerce.
*   **Layout:** It features a vertical stack: a product image (`placeholder_image.jpg`) at the top, followed by a section with product information. This information includes the product name ("AcousticPro Wireless Headphones"), brand ("By SoundWave Audio"), a star rating (4 gold stars, 1 grey star) with text indicating "4.6 stars | 2,155 ratings", the price (current price "$149.99" in red, original price "$199.99" strikethrough in grey), and a brief product description. At the bottom are two buttons: "Add to Cart" and "Add to Wishlist". The card itself is 340px wide.
*   **Colors:** The page has a light gray background (`#f4f4f9`), while the card is white (`#ffffff`). Text is primarily dark gray (`#333333` for name, `#555555` for description) for readability, with lighter gray (`#777777`) for brand and review text. Stars are gold (`#f39c12`) and light gray (`#d0d0d0`). The "Add to Cart" button is a vibrant blue (`#3498db`) with white text, and the "Wishlist" button is light gray (`#ecf0f1`) with dark text and a red heart icon.
*   **Sizes:** The product name is the largest text (`22px`), followed by the current price (`24px`). The image area is `220px` high. Buttons are full-width within the card's info section.
*   **Design Choices:** This layout is standard for product cards, making it intuitive. The vertical flow guides users from visual (image) to informational (details) to action (buttons). Colors are chosen for visual hierarchy: blue as a primary call-to-action, red to highlight the sale price. The 'Lato' font ensures good readability. Hover effects (card lift, button shade changes) provide subtle interactive feedback.

## Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This product item widget is designed to be a core content element. Its appearance is typically triggered by:
1.  **Page Load:** It appears when the HTML page containing it is loaded by the browser.
2.  **Navigation:** Users would see this component upon navigating to a product detail page (PDP) where it would be the main focus, or as one of many items on a product listing page (e.g., category page, search results) or a homepage feature section.

In this specific implementation, it's rendered statically as part of the initial page content, positioned 20px from the top of the viewport. It's not dynamically triggered by a user interaction like a modal pop-up in this context, but rather forms part of the standard page structure.

## Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can interact with this widget in several ways:
1.  **Visual Consumption:** Users can view the product image and read all textual information: product name, brand, star rating, review count, pricing details, and the description to understand the product.
2.  **Add to Cart:** Users can click the "Add to Cart" button. In a functional e-commerce site, this action would typically add the product to their virtual shopping cart, often accompanied by visual feedback like a success message, a change in button text, or an update to a mini-cart icon.
3.  **Add to Wishlist:** Users can click the "Add to Wishlist" button, which includes a heart icon. This would normally save the product to a user's personal wishlist. The button or icon might change (e.g., heart fills in) to indicate the item has been added.
4.  **Hover Effects:** Subtle visual feedback is provided on mouse hover: the entire card slightly lifts and its shadow becomes more pronounced, and buttons change their background color, signaling that these elements are interactive.
While not implemented here, in a full e-commerce site, clicking the product image might open a larger view or an image gallery, and clicking the rating might navigate to a customer reviews section.
