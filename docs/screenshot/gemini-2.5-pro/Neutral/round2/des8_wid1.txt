## Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The shopping cart widget is designed as a fixed-position panel, appearing on the top-right of the viewport with a 20px margin. It has a width of 380px, providing ample space for content without being overly intrusive.

**Colors:** The primary background is white (#ffffff) for a clean, modern feel. Text colors are predominantly dark grey (#333333) for main information and lighter grey (#555555, #777777) for secondary details, ensuring good readability. Borders and dividers use light greys (#e0e0e0, #eeeeee) for subtle separation. The "Proceed to Checkout" button uses a vibrant green (#28a745) as an accent, drawing attention to the primary call-to-action. A softer red (#d9534f) is used for the "Remove" button.

**Size of Elements:** The main heading "Your Cart" is prominent at 1.5em. Product names are 0.95em, and images are 70x70px, large enough for recognition. Interactive elements like quantity buttons and the close button have sufficient padding/size for easy clicking.

**Layout:** The widget uses a vertical flex layout. A header contains the title and a close button. Below is a scrollable list of cart items. Each item is laid out horizontally using flexbox: image on the left, then product info (name, meta, quantity controls, remove button) in the middle, and item total price on the right. The summary (subtotal, shipping, total) is at the bottom, followed by action buttons ("Checkout", "Continue Shopping").

**Design Choices:** These choices aim for a user-friendly, familiar e-commerce experience. The clean aesthetic builds trust. Clear visual hierarchy guides the user from items to summary to actions. Fixed positioning keeps the cart accessible. Contrasting colors for CTAs improve conversion. Scrollability handles varying cart sizes. The layout mirrors common e-commerce patterns, reducing cognitive load.

## Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

In a dynamic e-commerce website, the appearance of this shopping cart widget would typically be triggered by one of several user actions:
1.  **Clicking a Cart Icon/Button:** Most commonly, users click a shopping bag or cart icon, usually located in the website's main header or navigation bar. This action would toggle the visibility of the cart widget, often as a fly-out panel or modal.
2.  **Adding an Item to Cart:** Sometimes, the cart widget might briefly appear (or an abbreviated version of it) as a confirmation immediately after a user clicks an "Add to Cart" button on a product page. This provides instant feedback that the item has been successfully added.
3.  **Hovering over Cart Icon (Less Common for Full Cart):** Some sites might show a mini-cart summary on hover, but typically a click is required to show the full interactive cart widget as designed here.

For this specific static component as requested, it is always visible, positioned at the top of the viewport, as per the requirements. However, its design is intended for the interactive scenarios described above.

## Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can perform several actions within this shopping cart widget:
1.  **View Cart Contents:** Users can see a detailed list of items they've added, including a small product image, product name, specific attributes (like color/size), and the total price for the quantity of that specific item.
2.  **Modify Item Quantity:** For each item, users can click "+" or "-" buttons to increase or decrease the quantity. In a live system, this would dynamically update the item's total price and the cart's overall subtotal and total.
3.  **Remove an Item:** Each item has a "Remove" button, allowing users to delete it from their cart. This would also trigger an update of the cart totals.
4.  **Review Cart Summary:** Users can view a breakdown of their order costs: the subtotal of all items, an indication for shipping costs (e.g., "Calculated at checkout"), and the final total amount.
5.  **Proceed to Checkout:** A prominent "Proceed to Checkout" button allows users to move to the next step in the purchasing process, typically leading to pages for shipping information, payment, and order confirmation.
6.  **Continue Shopping:** A "Continue Shopping" button provides an option to close or hide the cart widget and return to browsing the website, perhaps navigating them back to the last viewed category or product page.
7.  **Close the Widget:** A close button (typically an "X" icon) in the cart's header allows users to dismiss the widget and return to their previous view on the site without proceeding to checkout or explicitly choosing to continue shopping.
8.  **Scroll Through Items:** If the number of items exceeds the visible area of the cart list, users can scroll to see all their selected products.
