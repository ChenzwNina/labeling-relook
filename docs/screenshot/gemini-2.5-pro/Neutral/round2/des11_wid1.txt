Q1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
The widget is a sleek, rectangular panel, approximately 580px wide, centered horizontally and fixed 20px from the top of the viewport. It features a clean white background (#ffffff) with 8px rounded corners and a soft box-shadow, creating a modern, elevated appearance over page content.
The heading ("Thinking of Cancelling Your StyleSavvy Gold Membership?") is a dark blue-gray (#2c3e50) at 22px. Body text is a softer gray (#555e69) at 15px for readability. A list of benefits members will lose is presented with vibrant green checkmarks (✓ #27ae60) to positively frame their value. Important billing details are highlighted in a light blue box (#eaf5fc) with a darker blue accent, while critical warnings about point forfeiture use a light red background (#fdecea) with a strong red accent for immediate attention.
Two prominent buttons complete the layout: "Yes, Cancel My Gold Membership" is a clear red (#e74c3c) signifying a decisive, potentially irreversible action. "No, I'll Keep My Benefits" is a contrasting, reassuring blue (#3498db). These choices aim for a professional, user-friendly e-commerce aesthetic that clearly communicates information and consequences, guiding the user through a significant decision.

Q2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
This widget is triggered when a user, already logged into their e-commerce account, navigates to their membership or subscription management section and explicitly clicks a button or link indicating their intent to cancel their ongoing membership (e.g., "Cancel Membership," "End Subscription"). It's not an unsolicited pop-up but a direct consequence of a user-initiated action, serving as a crucial confirmation step. This ensures users are fully aware of the implications before finalizing the cancellation, providing a "moment of pause" and a chance to reconsider or confirm their decision.

Q3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
Users can interact with the widget in the following ways:
1.  **Information Consumption:** They can read the title, the main message expressing regret and outlining the purpose, the list of specific "StyleSavvy Gold" membership benefits they will forfeit, details on when their current membership and benefits will cease, and a clear warning regarding the loss of loyalty points.
2.  **Confirm Cancellation:** By clicking the red "Yes, Cancel My Gold Membership" button. This action would typically initiate the backend cancellation process and then direct the user to a confirmation screen or update their account status page.
3.  **Retain Membership:** By clicking the blue "No, I'll Keep My Benefits" button. This action would close or hide the cancellation widget, keeping their membership active, and likely return them to their account dashboard or the previous page.
The widget is designed to elicit a direct choice between these two actions, lacking an 'X' to close, thereby ensuring the user consciously addresses the cancellation decision.
