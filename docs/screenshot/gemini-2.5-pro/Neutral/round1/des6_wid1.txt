## Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a rectangular card with rounded corners, fixed at the top center of the viewport, 20 pixels from the top edge. It has a white background (#ffffff) with a subtle box shadow for depth and a light border (#e0e0e0).

**Layout:** It employs a horizontal flex layout. On the left, there's a product image (160x160px) in a wrapper. The right side contains product details, stacked vertically: a "Flash Sale!" tag (bright red #e74c3c, white text), product name (large, dark blue-gray #2c3e50), brand (gray #7f8c8d), star rating (orange #f39c12 for filled stars, light gray #bdc3c7 for empty), short description (dark gray #555), price section (sale price in large dark red #c0392b, original price strikethrough in gray #95a5a6, green #27ae60 discount badge), and a prominent "Grab This Deal" call-to-action button (primary blue #007bff, white text). A close button (gray '×') is in the top-right corner.

**Design Choices:**
*   **Fixed Positioning & Prominence:** Meets the requirement for top-of-viewport display, ensuring high visibility for promotions.
*   **Color Psychology:** Uses standard e-commerce color cues: red for urgency/sale, green for savings, blue for trust/action, orange for positive rating. White background and dark text ensure readability.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Larger fonts for name and sale price, distinct button color, and strategic spacing guide the user's eye to key information.
*   **Modern Aesthetics:** Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and clean typography create a contemporary, trustworthy feel.
*   **User Experience:** Clickable image and name (common pattern), clear CTA, and a close button respect user control. Responsive design ensures usability across devices.

## Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The widget appears as soon as the page (or the relevant section of a single-page application) loads and the component is rendered in the Document Object Model (DOM). Its appearance is primarily triggered by its CSS rules: `position: fixed;`, `top: 20px;`, `left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);`. These styles ensure it's immediately placed at the specified location in the viewport, overlaid on other page content, without requiring any user interaction like scrolling or clicking.

While its fundamental appearance is CSS-driven upon rendering, in a real-world scenario, its inclusion in the DOM might be conditional. For example, it could be triggered by:
*   A specific promotion being active (e.g., "Flash Sale").
*   User segmentation (e.g., new vs. returning visitor).
*   A particular time or date for timed offers.
However, based on the prompt focusing on HTML/CSS, the direct trigger is its defined styling upon rendering.

## Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users can interact with the widget in several ways:

1.  **Hover Effects:**
    *   **Product Image:** Hovering over the image causes a slight zoom effect (transform: scale(1.05)), indicating interactivity.
    *   **Product Name:** Hovering over the product name link changes its color, signaling it's clickable.
    *   **CTA Button ("Grab This Deal"):** Hovering changes its background color to a darker blue and slightly lifts it (transform: translateY(-2px)), providing visual feedback.
    *   **Close Button:** Hovering changes the '×' icon's color, making it more prominent.

2.  **Click Actions:**
    *   **Product Image/Name:** Clicking on the product image or name (both are links) would typically navigate the user to the full product detail page. (Links currently point to "#").
    *   **CTA Button ("Grab This Deal"):** Clicking this button would usually add the product to the cart, or navigate to a checkout page or the product page.
    *   **Close Button ('×'):** Clicking this button hides the widget (using a simple inline JavaScript for demonstration: `this.parentElement.style.display='none'`). This allows users to dismiss the promotional item if they wish.

3.  **Information Consumption:** Users can read the product name, brand, description, price, discount, and reviews. Text content is selectable for copying.

4.  **Responsive Interaction:** The widget's layout adapts to screen size. On smaller screens (max-width: 600px), it stacks vertically with centered text and a full-width CTA button to maintain usability.
