Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
Answer: The component is a clean, card-style widget centered horizontally near the top of the viewport. It has a white background with a subtle shadow to make it float above the page content. The color scheme is primarily neutral (black and grey text on white) to ensure readability, with a vibrant green (#28a745) used as an accent. This green highlights key information like the progress bar and current status, as green is universally associated with progress and success.

The layout is hierarchical. A large, bold heading immediately tells the user the main status. A visual progress bar gives an at-a-glance summary. Below, a vertical timeline presents detailed updates in reverse chronological order, with the latest update marked clearly. Font sizes vary to guide the user's eye from general status to specific details. This entire structure is designed to deliver crucial information efficiently and intuitively.

Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
Answer: This widget is designed to appear proactively to enhance the user experience. The primary trigger would be a logged-in user, who has an active order in the "shipped" or "out for delivery" stage, visiting the website's main pages like the homepage or their account dashboard. The system would check the user's recent orders upon page load and display the widget if a relevant order is found. An alternative trigger could be the user clicking a "Track My Order" link from a shipping confirmation email. This link would direct them to the site and automatically pop up this widget, possibly using a URL parameter to identify the specific order to display.

Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
Answer: Users have several straightforward interactions designed for convenience and control.
1.  **Viewing:** The primary interaction is passive viewing. Users can quickly absorb the order's status from the header, progress bar, and the latest timeline entry.
2.  **Scrolling:** For orders with a long history, the timeline is scrollable, allowing users to review every step of the package's journey.
3.  **Clicking for Details:** Users can click the "View Order Details" button. This action would navigate them to the full order summary page, where they can see item details, billing information, and other related data.
4.  **Dismissing:** A prominent 'X' button in the top-right corner allows the user to close the widget at any time. This interaction gives the user full control over their browsing experience, letting them hide the tracker to focus on other parts of the site.
