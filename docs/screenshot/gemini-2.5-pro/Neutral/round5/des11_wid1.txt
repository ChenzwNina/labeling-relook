1. Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a modal dialog box centered horizontally at the top of the viewport. It has a clean, white background with a subtle border and a soft box-shadow, making it appear to "float" above the page content and command the user's focus.

- **Layout:** It follows a clear vertical hierarchy. A bold heading asks a direct question, followed by text explaining the consequence, a bulleted list of benefits the user will lose, and finally two distinct action buttons.
- **Colors & Elements:** The primary "Keep My Benefits" button is a bright, vibrant orange, a color often used to create a sense of urgency and draw attention. In contrast, the "Continue to Cancel" button is styled as a secondary action, with a plain white background and blue text, de-emphasizing it. The benefits list uses green checkmark icons to visually reinforce the positive value of the features being lost.

These design choices are intentional and persuasive. The goal is to make the user pause and reconsider their decision by clearly highlighting the value they are about to give up, thereby serving as a customer retention tool.

2. What triggers the appearance of this widget?

This widget appears as a direct result of a user-initiated action. It is triggered when a logged-in user navigates to their "Account," "Profile," or "Manage Membership" section of the website and explicitly clicks on a link or button with a label like "Cancel Membership" or "End Subscription." It is not a popup that appears unprompted. It functions as an intermediary confirmation and retention step in the cancellation user flow, designed to prevent accidental cancellations and give the business one last opportunity to retain the customer.

3. Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

A user has three primary interactions with this widget:

1.  **Keep Membership:** Clicking the prominent orange "Keep My Benefits" button. This is the primary, preferred action. It would close the modal and abort the cancellation process, likely returning the user to their main account page with their membership intact.
2.  **Continue Cancellation:** Clicking the secondary "Continue to Cancel" button. This action confirms the user's intent to cancel and would navigate them to the next and likely final step of the cancellation process, which might involve a feedback survey or a final confirmation screen.
3.  **Close the Widget:** Clicking the 'Ã—' icon in the top-right corner. This acts as a neutral escape hatch. It dismisses the widget without making any changes, effectively having the same outcome as clicking "Keep My Benefits." It allows users who clicked by mistake or have second thoughts to easily exit the flow.
