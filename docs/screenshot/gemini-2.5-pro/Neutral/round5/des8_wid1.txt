### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The shopping cart widget is a clean, modern-looking panel positioned at the top-right of the screen. It has a white background with a subtle border and shadow, making it stand out against the main page content. The layout is structured vertically: a header with the title "Your Cart" and a close button, a scrollable list of products, and a footer with the subtotal and action buttons. Each product in the list is laid out horizontally with its image on the left, details (name, specs, quantity controls) in the middle, and price on the right.

These design choices are based on established e-commerce conventions to create an intuitive user experience. The white background provides high contrast for text and images. Top-right positioning is standard, so users know where to look. The primary "Checkout" button uses a strong, solid color (green) to signify a positive action, while the secondary "View Cart" button has a more neutral, outlined style. This visual hierarchy guides the user toward the most important next step.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is typically triggered by one of two user actions. The most common trigger is the user clicking on a shopping cart icon, which is almost universally located in the website's main navigation header. This allows users to review their cart's contents at any time.

A secondary, proactive trigger can occur immediately after a user clicks an "Add to Cart" button on a product page. In this scenario, the cart widget would automatically slide into view for a few seconds. This provides immediate visual confirmation that the item has been successfully added, shows the updated subtotal, and allows the user to quickly proceed to checkout or dismiss the cart to continue shopping. This interaction reduces uncertainty and enhances the user's sense of control.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several key interactions available within this cart widget, designed for quick management without leaving the current page.

1.  **Review Contents:** Users can scan the list of added items, viewing product names, key specifications (like size or color), and individual prices.
2.  **Adjust Quantity:** For each item, users can click the `+` or `-` buttons to increase or decrease the quantity, with the subtotal updating in real-time.
3.  **Remove Item:** Users can click the "Remove" link for any item to delete it from the cart entirely.
4.  **Proceed to Next Step:** The footer contains two clear calls-to-action. Users can click "Proceed to Checkout" to begin the payment process or "View Cart" to navigate to a dedicated, full-page view of their shopping cart for more detailed options (e.g., adding a gift message).
5.  **Dismiss Widget:** Users can click the 'Ã—' icon in the header to close the cart and resume browsing the site.
