### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget is a vertical panel with a clean, modern aesthetic, positioned in the top-right corner of the viewport. It uses a neutral color palette—a white background (#ffffff) with dark gray text (#333) and subtle light gray borders (#e5e5e5)—to ensure it fits into various site designs without clashing. A drop shadow lifts it from the page, indicating it's an overlay.

The layout is structured into three clear sections: header, item list, and footer. Elements are sized for clarity and ease of use; for example, the checkout button is large, full-width, and colored a vibrant blue (#007bff) to make it the primary call-to-action. Product images are 70x70px, large enough to be identifiable but small enough to allow multiple items in view. These choices are based on established e-commerce conventions, which promote user familiarity and a frictionless, intuitive experience. The goal is to provide information clearly and guide the user toward completing their purchase.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this shopping cart widget is typically triggered by a user action. The most common trigger is the user clicking on a shopping cart icon, which is usually located persistently in the website's main navigation header. When clicked, the widget slides or fades into view from the side of the screen, presenting a summary of the cart's contents without navigating away from the current page.

An alternative trigger is an "Add to Cart" event. After a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button on a product page, the widget can automatically appear to provide immediate visual confirmation that the item has been successfully added. This reassures the user and allows them to quickly review their cart or continue shopping seamlessly. In either case, the trigger is designed to be an intuitive and responsive part of the shopping flow.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several key interactions with this cart widget, designed to give them full control over their pre-checkout experience. They can:

1.  **View Cart Summary:** At a glance, users see a list of products, including their name, attributes (like size/color), quantity, and individual price.
2.  **Adjust Quantity:** Users can increase or decrease the quantity of any item using the "+" and "-" buttons. This allows for quick adjustments without having to visit the full cart page.
3.  **Remove an Item:** A trash can icon next to each item allows for its complete removal from the cart with a single click.
4.  **Proceed to Checkout:** The primary call-to-action, a prominent "Proceed to Checkout" button, navigates the user to the next step of the purchasing process.
5.  **Close the Widget:** Users can close the widget using the "×" button in the header to hide it and continue browsing the website.
6.  **Scroll Items:** If the number of items exceeds the visible area, a scrollbar appears, allowing the user to browse their entire selection.
