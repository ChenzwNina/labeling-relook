### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a clean, card-style widget that floats at the top center of the screen. It has a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow to lift it off the page. The layout is structured with a clear hierarchy: a main header with a bold title ("Your Order is on its Way!") and a smaller order ID, an info block with a prominent, blue estimated delivery date, and finally, the core progress tracker.

The progress tracker uses a horizontal bar with four distinct steps, each marked by a circular icon. Completed steps are filled with a solid, trustworthy blue (#007bff) and feature a checkmark. The current "active" step is outlined in blue to draw the eye, while future steps are a neutral grey. This color-coding provides an immediate, intuitive understanding of the order's status. These design choices prioritize clarity and user confidence. The focused layout and professional color scheme are designed to quickly answer the user's primary question—"Where is my order?"—without causing distraction or confusion.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is typically user-initiated. It would most commonly be triggered when a customer clicks a "Track Order" button or link. This link could be located in several key places:

1.  **Post-Purchase Confirmation Page:** Immediately after an order is placed.
2.  **Order History Page:** Within the customer's account, next to a specific order.
3.  **Shipping Confirmation Email:** A direct link in an email that brings the user back to the website and displays this tracker.

Upon clicking, the widget appears as an overlay or banner at the top of the current page. This design avoids a full page reload, providing instant access to tracking information and creating a seamless, modern user experience. It's an "on-demand" component rather than one that appears automatically, respecting the user's current browsing flow.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

User interactions with this widget are designed to be simple and purposeful.

1.  **Information Consumption (Primary):** The main interaction is passive viewing. The user can immediately see the estimated delivery date, the current stage of their order in the progress bar, and the dates associated with each completed step. The visual hierarchy guides their eyes to the most important information first.

2.  **Dismissal:** The user has full control to close the widget at any time by clicking the '×' button in the top-right corner. This allows them to easily return to browsing the rest of the website without the tracker obstructing their view.

3.  **Hover (Potential Enhancement):** While not explicitly built in this static example, hovering over the progress step icons or dates could trigger tooltips. These tooltips could provide more granular details, such as the exact time of a status update (e.g., "Shipped: Tue, June 11 at 4:15 PM") or the specific carrier facility location. This adds a layer of detail for interested users without cluttering the main interface.
