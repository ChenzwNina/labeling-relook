### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The filter panel is a 300px wide, white card with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, making it float above the page content. It is vertically organized, with a fixed header and footer, and a central scrollable area for filter groups.

*   **Colors:** The palette is clean and professional. A white background (`#ffffff`) provides high contrast for the dark grey text (`#343a40`). The primary interactive color is a vibrant blue (`#007bff`), used for button backgrounds, selected states, and focus rings. This scheme ensures readability and draws attention to key actions without being overwhelming.
*   **Elements & Layout:** The layout uses clear visual hierarchy. A bold header "Filter & Sort" immediately orients the user. Each filter group ("Category", "Price", etc.) has a title and is separated by a light grey border. Interactive elements are designed for intuitive use: custom checkboxes, circular color swatches that enlarge on selection, and pill-shaped size toggles. These choices create a modern, user-friendly experience that is common in leading e-commerce sites, prioritizing clarity and ease of interaction.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

For a desktop or large tablet view, this widget is designed to be persistently visible. It would appear automatically on page load of a product listing page (e.g., when a user clicks on "Men's Apparel" or searches for "jackets"). Its fixed position at the top-left of the viewport ensures it's always accessible for refining product results without extra clicks.

On smaller mobile screens, where space is limited, this panel would typically be hidden by default. Its appearance would be triggered by the user tapping a "Filter" or "Refine" button, usually located near the top of the product list. The panel would then slide in from the side or appear as a modal overlay.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have a comprehensive set of interactions to refine product listings:

1.  **Multi-Select Filtering:** Users can check and uncheck multiple checkboxes in the "Category" and "Size" groups to broaden or narrow their search (e.g., view both "Hoodies" and "Jackets" in size "M").
2.  **Single-Select Filtering:** For colors, users click a circular swatch to select a single color. Clicking a different color deselects the previous one.
3.  **Range Filtering:** Users can define a specific price range by typing minimum and maximum values into the corresponding input fields.
4.  **Applying Filters:** Clicking the primary "Apply Filters" button submits all selected criteria, which would then trigger an update of the products displayed on the page.
5.  **Clearing Filters:** Clicking the "Clear All" button resets every filter option to its default, unchecked, or empty state, allowing the user to start over.
6.  **Scrolling:** If the list of filter options is long, users can scroll vertically within the main content area of the panel to access all available choices.
