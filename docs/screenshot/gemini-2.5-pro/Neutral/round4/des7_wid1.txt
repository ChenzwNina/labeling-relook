1. The widget is a self-contained card with a clean, modern design, positioned in the top-right of the viewport. It has a white background with soft, rounded corners and a subtle shadow to make it 'float' above the page content. The primary text is a dark grey for high readability. The layout follows a clear visual hierarchy: a main title, followed by a large, bold overall numeric rating (e.g., "4.8"). Key accents use a warm, gold color (`#f39c12`), specifically for star icons and the progress bars, which is universally understood for ratings. The main call-to-action button is a contrasting, trustworthy blue (`#3498db`) to draw the user's eye. These design choices are made to be professional, trustworthy, and visually appealing, ensuring the widget feels like a credible part of a real e-commerce site and is easy to understand at a glance.

2. The appearance of this widget is most commonly triggered by a direct user action, such as clicking on a "Reviews" link or the star rating summary typically found near the product title on a product detail page. This ensures the widget appears when the user explicitly shows interest in seeing detailed feedback, respecting their browsing experience. Alternatively, it could be triggered automatically as a form of "social proof" if a user dwells on a product page for an extended period (e.g., 10-15 seconds), proactively offering information to help their purchase decision without being overly intrusive. In either case, the trigger is context-aware and aims to provide helpful information at a relevant moment in the user's journey.

3. Users have three primary interactions with the widget. First, they can passively consume the information: viewing the overall average score, the total number of reviews, and the detailed percentage breakdown for each star level. This allows for a quick assessment of product sentiment. Second, they can dismiss the widget at any time by clicking the 'Ã—' close icon in the top-right corner, giving them full control over their viewport. Third, they can engage actively by clicking the "Write a Review" button. This action would typically navigate them to a separate review submission form or open a modal window, allowing them to contribute their own rating and feedback. Minor hover effects on the close icon and button provide visual feedback, confirming their clickability.
