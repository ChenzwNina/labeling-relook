### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The component is a horizontally scrolling product carousel titled "Just For You", set against a light grey page background. Each product is displayed on a clean white card with rounded corners and a subtle shadow that deepens on hover, creating a sense of depth. The layout of each card is vertical: a square product image on top, followed by the product name in bold, dark text, the price in a distinct blue, and finally a prominent blue "Add to Cart" button.

This design is chosen for its clarity and modern aesthetic. The neutral color palette (white, grey, dark text) ensures the colorful product images are the main focus. Using a strong accent blue for the price and call-to-action button guides the user's eye to key information and interactive elements, a common practice to optimize for conversions. The horizontal layout allows for showcasing many products without consuming excessive vertical space, making it ideal for placement near the top of a page.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is triggered by page load. It is not a pop-up or a dynamically appearing element based on a specific action like scrolling to a certain point. Instead, it's a static content block that is an integral part of a page's layout. It would typically be placed on high-traffic pages like the homepage, a category landing page, or a personalized user dashboard. For a "Just For You" section, the specific products displayed would be dynamically populated by the server based on the user's account data (e.g., past purchases, browsing history) as soon as the page is requested, making it feel personalized from the moment it loads.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several clear interaction points with this widget. First, they can **horizontally scroll** the list using a mouse wheel, trackpad gesture, or by dragging the scrollbar (though it's hidden by default for a cleaner look) to browse all the recommended items. Second, they can **hover** over any product card. This triggers a visual feedback animation where the card lifts and its shadow becomes more pronounced, indicating it's a clickable element. Third, they can **click** on the main body of the card (the image or title) which would navigate them to that product's detailed description page. Finally, they can click the **"Add to Cart" button**, which would add the item directly to their shopping cart, likely providing an immediate confirmation like the cart icon updating.
