### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?

The widget has a clean, modern design intended to build trust and encourage sign-ups. It appears as a floating card near the top of the page, centered horizontally. 

**Colors:** The palette is professional and minimalist. A white background (#FFFFFF) provides high contrast for readability. Text is a dark gray (#212529) for clarity, while a secondary, lighter gray (#495057) is used for descriptive text. The primary action color is a vibrant blue (#007BFF), used for links and the main call-to-action button, drawing the user's eye to key interactive elements.

**Elements & Layout:** The layout is a single, organized column to guide the user's focus from top to bottom. It uses generous padding (32px) and rounded corners (12px) for a soft, friendly appearance. Input fields are large with clear labels, and a blue focus state reduces ambiguity. The font, 'Inter', is a sans-serif known for its excellent screen legibility. These choices reduce cognitive load and create a seamless, professional experience that feels secure and easy to navigate.

### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?

The appearance of this widget is typically user-initiated to ensure it is not perceived as an intrusive interruption. The most common trigger is the user clicking on a "Create Account" or "Sign Up" button, which is usually located in the website's main header or navigation bar. 

Alternatively, it could be triggered contextually. For instance, if a non-logged-in user tries to perform an action that requires an account, such as saving an item to a wishlist or proceeding to checkout from the cart page, this widget would appear to facilitate the required sign-up process, making it a natural and helpful step in their user journey.

### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?

Users have several direct interactions with this widget, all centered around the goal of creating an account or opting out.

1.  **Form Entry:** Users can type their full name, email, and password into the respective input fields.
2.  **Consent:** They must click the checkbox to agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The links within this text are also clickable, which would navigate them to those respective pages for review.
3.  **Submission:** Clicking the "Create My Account" button will validate the form. If all fields are correctly filled, it submits their information to create the account.
4.  **Dismissal:** Users can click the 'Ã—' icon in the top-right corner to close the widget and cancel the sign-up process, returning to their previous view.
5.  **Alternative Action:** If the user realizes they already have an account, they can click the "Log In" link at the bottom. This would typically dismiss the sign-up widget and display a login widget instead.
