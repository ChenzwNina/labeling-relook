### Question 1: Can you describe how the widget looks, such as its colors, size of elements, and layout? Why do you make these design choices?
        
        The component is a sleek, rectangular banner positioned at the top of the page. It features a deep navy blue (#1a253c) background with crisp white text, creating a high-contrast, premium feel that builds trust. The layout, managed by flexbox, places descriptive text and an icon on the left, with an email input field and a call-to-action button on the right. The button has a striking gold color (#e0ac5d), making it the focal point to guide user action. A subtle star icon adds a touch of "VIP" branding. This design is chosen to be noticeable without being disruptive. The professional color scheme conveys value, and the clear layout ensures the offer and the action required are immediately understood by the user. On mobile, it gracefully stacks into a single column for optimal readability and usability.
        
        ### Question 2: What triggers the appearance of this widget?
        
        The appearance of this widget is best triggered by user behavior to maximize relevance and conversion without causing annoyance. Common triggers include:
        1. **Time on Site:** The banner could appear after a user has been browsing the site for a specific duration, such as 30 seconds. This ensures the user has shown some engagement.
        2. **Page Views:** It could be triggered after the user visits 2-3 different pages, indicating a deeper interest in the store's products.
        3. **Cart Action:** A highly effective trigger is when a non-member adds an item to their cart. The banner can then appear, offering free shipping or a discount on their current order if they sign up, creating a powerful, immediate incentive.
        4. **Exit Intent:** The widget could appear when the user's cursor moves towards the top of the browser window, signaling an intent to leave the site.
        
        ### Question 3: Can you describe the full range of interactions users can have with the widget?
        
        Users have three primary ways to interact with the widget:
        
        1. **Sign Up (Primary Action):** The main goal is for the user to type their email address into the input field and click the "Join for Free" button. This action would submit their email to the e-commerce platform's database, signing them up for the membership and marketing communications. Upon successful submission, the banner should ideally disappear and be replaced with a brief "Thank you for joining!" confirmation message.
        
        2. **Dismiss (Secondary Action):** Users who are not interested can click the 'Ã—' close button. This action immediately hides the banner from view. Good practice dictates that this action should set a browser cookie or use local storage to prevent the banner from reappearing for a set period (e.g., 7-30 days), respecting the user's choice and avoiding a negative experience.
        
        3. **Ignore (Passive Action):** Due to its fixed but non-modal design, users can simply ignore the banner and continue scrolling and interacting with the main website content below it. The banner remains visible at the top but does not obstruct their browsing journey.
