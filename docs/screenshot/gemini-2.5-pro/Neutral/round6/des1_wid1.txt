1. The widget is a rectangular banner with rounded corners, positioned centrally at the top of the screen. It features a warm, energetic color scheme, using a linear gradient from a bright orange (#FF8C00) to a deep orange-red (#FF4500). This choice is designed to be eye-catching and evoke feelings of excitement and urgency, suitable for a sale. The text is white for high contrast and readability. The headline is large (1.2rem) and bolded to grab attention, while the descriptive text is slightly smaller. The layout, managed by flexbox, cleanly separates the promotional text and the call-to-action button from the close icon, creating a balanced and uncluttered appearance. The design prioritizes a clear message and an obvious primary action.

    2. This type of promotional banner is typically triggered on page load for a new user session. When a visitor first arrives on the website or begins a new browsing session, the banner appears automatically. The goal is to immediately inform every potential customer about the most important current promotion to maximize its visibility and impact. In more advanced setups, its appearance could be delayed by a few seconds or be triggered by specific user behavior (like visiting a certain category page), but a session start is the most common and effective trigger for a site-wide deal.

    3. Users have two primary interactions with the widget. First, they can click the "Shop The Deals" button. This is the main call-to-action (CTA) and would navigate the user directly to a curated page displaying all the products included in the flash sale. This provides a seamless path from awareness to conversion. Second, users can click the 'Ã—' close button. This action dismisses the banner, removing it from the viewport. A well-implemented site would use session storage or a cookie to ensure the banner does not reappear for that user during the same browsing session, respecting their choice to hide the promotion.
