    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page. Categories are displayed in a horizontal list with a coral (#ff6f61) hover effect for interactivity, using a consistent font size of 16px for readability. The layout is centered with a max-width of 1200px for balance on larger screens and switches to a vertical stack on mobile for usability. These choices prioritize visibility, consistency, and responsiveness, aligning with e-commerce design standards. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears statically at the top of every page of the e-commerce website, positioned with a 20px top margin. It is a persistent navigation element, triggered by the page load, ensuring users always have access to product categories without additional interaction. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over category links, which change color to indicate clickability, and clicking to navigate to specific category pages. The design prevents errors by limiting interactions to navigation, with clear visual feedback via hover and active states. On mobile, the layout adjusts for easier tapping, supporting efficient task execution. -->
