    <!-- Question 1: The search panel is a fixed bar at the top with a 20px margin, spanning the full width for high visibility. It uses a clean white background (#ffffff) with a subtle shadow for elevation. The search input occupies 60% of the width (max 600px) for focus, with a blue (#007bff) search button for clear action affordance. The category dropdown uses a neutral gray (#f9f9f9) to differentiate it. Design choices prioritize clarity, accessibility, and consistency with e-commerce standards, ensuring users can quickly locate and use the search function. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The search panel appears persistently at the top of every page on the e-commerce website. It is a core navigation tool, always visible to facilitate product searches without needing specific triggers like user actions or page changes. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by typing queries in the search input (with focus feedback via border color change), selecting a category from the dropdown (with hover feedback), and clicking the search button (disabled if input is empty for constraint). Hover effects on the button and dropdown enhance interactivity, while the layout supports efficient task execution by minimizing clicks. -->
