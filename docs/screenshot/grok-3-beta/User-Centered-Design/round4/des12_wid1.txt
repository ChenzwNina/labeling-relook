    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring high visibility. It uses a blue (#007bff) primary color for the "Create Account" button and links, providing a consistent and trustworthy e-commerce aesthetic. Form fields are 100% width within a 400px container for readability, with clear labels in gray (#555). Inputs have a light border (#ddd) that turns blue on focus for feedback. These choices prioritize clarity, consistency, and user-friendly sizing for efficient interaction. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" link, typically located in the header of the e-commerce website or during checkout when a user opts to register for faster future purchases. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can enter their full name, email, and password, with real-time validation providing feedback via error messages. The button remains disabled until all fields are filled and passwords match, preventing invalid submissions. Hover effects on the button and links indicate interactivity, while clicking "Create Account" submits the form if valid. Users can also click terms links for more information. -->
