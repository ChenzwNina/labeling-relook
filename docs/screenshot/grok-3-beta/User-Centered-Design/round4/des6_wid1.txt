Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for the product card, a subtle shadow for depth, and a hover effect for interactivity (slight lift and enhanced shadow). The color scheme includes a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for the price and "Add to Cart" button to draw attention to key actions. The layout is compact (300px width) with a balanced hierarchy—image (200px height), title (18px), price (16px), and description (14px)—ensuring readability and focus. These choices prioritize visibility, consistency, and a satisfying user experience aligned with e-commerce standards.

Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or search results within an e-commerce website. It is triggered by user navigation to a category or search query, displaying individual items as part of a grid or list of products available for purchase.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the product card for visual feedback (lift effect), clicking the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase (with color change feedback on hover and click), and viewing product details like image, title, price, and description. Constraints prevent invalid actions (e.g., no editable fields), ensuring efficient and clear task execution.
