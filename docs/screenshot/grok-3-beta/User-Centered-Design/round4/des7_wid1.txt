    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. The color scheme uses gold (#f1c40f) for ratings to signify quality, blue (#3498db) for interactive elements like buttons for trust, and neutral grays for text. The layout is centered with a max-width of 1200px for readability, featuring large, bold headers (24px) and a prominent average rating (48px).
