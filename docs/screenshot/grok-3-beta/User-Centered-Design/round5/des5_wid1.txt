<!-- Question 1: The filter panel uses a clean white background with subtle gray borders and shadows for a modern look. The layout is responsive, using flexbox to arrange sections (Category, Price Range, Brand) side-by-side on larger screens and stacked on smaller ones. Text is dark gray for readability, with blue hover effects on labels and buttons for interactivity. Element sizes are balancedâ€”headings are 16px, labels 14px, and inputs are compact for efficiency. These choices ensure clarity, accessibility, and a professional e-commerce aesthetic. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears at the top of the product listing page, with a 20px margin from the viewport top, triggered by default when users navigate to the catalog or search results. It remains persistent to facilitate filtering at any time. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact by checking/unchecking category and brand options, entering price ranges, and clicking "Apply Filters" to update results. Hover effects on labels and buttons provide feedback, while disabled states on the button prevent invalid submissions (e.g., negative prices). The design constrains invalid inputs via HTML attributes like 'min' and 'step'. -->
