    <!-- Question 1: The sign-in widget features a clean, modern design with a white background container, subtle shadow for depth, and a max-width of 400px for readability, centered on the page. The color scheme uses a professional blue (#007bff) for buttons and links, with neutral grays for text and borders for contrast and focus. Input fields are full-width with padding for easy interaction, and error messages are red for visibility. These choices ensure a user-friendly, trustworthy look consistent with e-commerce aesthetics, promoting trust and ease of use. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign In" link or button from the websiteâ€™s header or attempts to access restricted features like checkout or account settings. It may also appear automatically on pages requiring authentication. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can enter their email and password, submit the form, and receive feedback via error messages if input is invalid. They can click "Forgot Password?" to reset credentials or "Create Account" to register. Hover effects on buttons and links provide visual cues, and input focus highlights guide interaction. -->
