    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for elevation, positioned 20px from the top. It uses a green (#28a745) for completed/active statuses and gray (#ccc) for pending ones, ensuring visibility. The layout is centered with a max-width of 800px for readability. Status circles (20x20px) and connecting lines visually guide users through the process. Buttons are blue (#007bff) with hover effects for interactivity. These choices enhance clarity, focus on status progression, and align with e-commerce design standards for trust and usability. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to the "Track Order" page or clicks on an order in their account dashboard after placing it. It can also be triggered by entering an order ID in a tracking tool on the website. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view the current status of their order via the visual tracker, hover over the "View Detailed Updates" button for feedback (color change), and click it to access detailed timelines or shipping info. The button is disabled if no updates are available, preventing invalid actions. Users cannot modify statuses, ensuring data integrity. -->
