    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel is a fixed, compact sidebar (250px wide) positioned at the top-left of the viewport with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a clean, modern look. It uses a blue (#007bff) apply button for high visibility and contrast, with hover and active states for feedback. Text is in grayscale for readability, and elements are spaced evenly with clear labels. These choices ensure a professional e-commerce aesthetic, prioritize usability, and maintain focus on functionality. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically when a user navigates to a product listing page on the e-commerce site. It remains fixed at the top-left to ensure constant accessibility while browsing products, aligning with user needs to refine search results at any time. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the panel by selecting a category from a dropdown, adjusting a price range slider (with real-time feedback), checking/unchecking brand options, and clicking the "Apply Filters" button to update results. Hover effects on the button and cursor changes on interactive elements provide feedback. These interactions are constrained to valid inputs (e.g., predefined categories), ensuring error prevention and efficient filtering. -->
