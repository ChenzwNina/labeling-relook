    <!-- Question 1: The shopping cart widget features a clean white background with a subtle shadow for depth, positioned at the top-right corner for easy access. It uses green (#2ecc71) for positive actions like checkout and red (#e74c3c) for removal, ensuring clear visual cues. The layout is compact (350px width) with item images (50x50px) and readable text (14-18px), balancing visibility and space. These choices prioritize accessibility, feedback, and consistency with e-commerce design norms. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when the user clicks the cart toggle button (a circular green icon labeled "Cart") located at the top-right corner. It can also be triggered programmatically after adding items to the cart, ensuring users can review their selections instantly. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can toggle the cart visibility via the button, view item details (image, name, price), remove items with a clear "Remove" button (with hover feedback), and proceed to checkout if items are present (disabled otherwise). Hover effects on buttons enhance interactivity, while constraints like a disabled checkout for an empty cart prevent invalid actions, supporting efficiency and satisfaction. -->
