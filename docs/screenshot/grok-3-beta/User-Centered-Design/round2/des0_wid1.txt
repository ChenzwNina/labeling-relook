    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. It uses a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention to key actions, ensuring high visibility. Product cards are uniformly sized (min 250px) in a responsive grid layout for consistency and efficient browsing. The hover effect (lift and shadow) provides clear feedback. These choices enhance visibility, consistency, and user satisfaction by mimicking familiar e-commerce aesthetics. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears automatically at the top of the homepage, positioned with a 20px margin from the top, to immediately showcase featured products. It can also be triggered or refreshed based on user filters, promotions, or seasonal updates managed by the backend. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for visual feedback (lift effect), clicking product images or titles to view detailed pages, and clicking "Add to Cart" buttons to purchase. Buttons disable post-click temporarily to prevent duplicate actions, ensuring constraints. These interactions support efficient task execution and clear affordances. -->
