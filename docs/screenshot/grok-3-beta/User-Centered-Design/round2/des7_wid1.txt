    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring visibility. The color scheme uses gold (#f1c40f) for stars and rating bars to signify quality, blue (#3498db) for the interactive button to draw attention, and neutral grays for text to maintain readability. The layout is centered with a max-width for responsiveness, using large fonts (24-28px) for headings and ratings, and smaller fonts (14-16px) for details. These choices enhance clarity, hierarchy, and trust, mimicking e-commerce aesthetics. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on a product detail page, triggered when a user navigates to view a specific item. It is positioned near the top of the page (with a 20px margin) to ensure immediate visibility of customer feedback before purchase decisions. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view the average rating, detailed breakdown of star ratings, and individual reviews for insights. They can interact by clicking the "Write a Review" button, which provides hover and active feedback for clarity. Constraints prevent invalid actions (e.g., no rating submission without login, though not coded here). The design supports efficient scanning and decision-making through clear visual hierarchy. -->
