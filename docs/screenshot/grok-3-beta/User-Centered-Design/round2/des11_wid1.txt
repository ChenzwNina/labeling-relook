    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, centered layout with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring high visibility. The color scheme includes a bold red (#e74c3c) for the cancel button to signify a critical action, gray (#ccc) for the back button to indicate neutrality, and green (#27ae60) for feedback text to convey success. Text sizes are hierarchical (24px for title, 16px for body) for readability. The design prioritizes clarity and focus on the cancellation process, aligning with e-commerce aesthetics of simplicity and trust. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user navigates to the membership cancellation section of their account settings on the ShopElite website, typically triggered by selecting a "Cancel Membership" option from their profile or subscription page. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by selecting reasons for cancellation via checkboxes, providing input on their decision. They can click "Confirm Cancellation" to finalize the process, receiving immediate feedback, or "Back to Account" to exit. The cancel button disables post-confirmation to prevent repeated actions, ensuring a clear, constrained interaction flow. -->
