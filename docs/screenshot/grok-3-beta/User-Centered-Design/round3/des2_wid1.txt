<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring high visibility at the top of the page (20px margin). Categories are displayed in a horizontal list with evenly spaced items, using a bold blue (#007BFF) for hover and active states against dark gray text (#333333) for contrast. Font size (16px) and padding ensure readability and clickability. The design choice prioritizes simplicity and consistency, aligning with e-commerce standards for easy navigation, while the sticky positioning ensures constant accessibility. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically at the top of the viewport on every page of the e-commerce site as a primary navigation tool. It is triggered by the page load and remains visible while scrolling due to its sticky positioning, ensuring users always have access to category browsing. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking on category links to navigate to respective product sections. Hover effects provide visual feedback with color changes, indicating clickable areas. The active state highlights the current category, guiding users. The design prevents irrelevant actions by limiting interactions to navigation, ensuring a focused and efficient experience. -->
