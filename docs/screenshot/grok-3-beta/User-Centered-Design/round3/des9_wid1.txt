    <!-- Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a blue (#007bff) accent color for interactive elements and pricing to draw attention, while neutral grays (#333, #666) ensure readability. Cards are uniformly sized with padding (15px) for clarity, and the layout is centered with a max-width of 1200px for responsiveness. These choices enhance visibility, consistency, and a professional e-commerce aesthetic. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears during the checkout process, typically after users have added items to their cart and are finalizing their order. It is triggered on the shipping and payment page to allow users to customize their delivery experience. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can select one shipping option by clicking a card, which highlights with a blue border for feedback. They can toggle add-ons via checkboxes, with immediate feedback messages confirming actions. Finally, users confirm selections with a button, which triggers a confirmation alert. Constraints like single shipping selection and disabled states prevent errors, ensuring efficient interaction. -->
