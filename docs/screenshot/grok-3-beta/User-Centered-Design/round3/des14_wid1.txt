    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses green (#28a745) for completed/active progress steps and blue (#007bff) for interactive buttons, ensuring high visibility and feedback. The layout is centered with a max-width of 1200px for readability, and progress circles (30x30px) with labels provide clear status updates. Responsive design adjusts for smaller screens. These choices prioritize clarity, consistency, and user satisfaction. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to the "Track Order" page or clicks on an order from their account dashboard after placing a purchase. It remains visible at the top of the viewport for easy access. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view detailed order information (ID, dates) and track progress through a visual bar and steps. They can interact by clicking "View Order Details" to see itemized lists or other specifics. The "Contact Support" button is disabled until certain conditions (e.g., delivery issues) are met, preventing invalid actions. Hover effects on buttons provide feedback, enhancing usability. -->
