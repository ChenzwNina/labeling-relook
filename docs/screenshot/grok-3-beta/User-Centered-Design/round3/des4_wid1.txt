    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards, a soft gray body background (#f5f5f5), and vibrant orange accents (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention. Each card is 250px wide minimum, arranged in a responsive grid for adaptability. Elements like images (200px height) and text are consistently sized for readability. These choices ensure visual hierarchy, brand consistency, and a professional e-commerce look that encourages browsing. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on the main page of the e-commerce website or category pages as a default component to showcase featured or relevant products. It may also load dynamically based on user search queries or personalized recommendations triggered by browsing history or filters applied. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for visual feedback (lift and shadow effects), clicking cards to view detailed product pages, and clicking "Add to Cart" buttons to initiate purchases. Buttons provide hover states for clarity and can be disabled if items are out of stock, preventing invalid actions. These interactions ensure efficient navigation and a satisfying shopping experience. -->
