    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a blue color scheme (#007bff) for interactive elements like the button and links, ensuring high visibility and consistency. Input fields are spacious (padding: 10px) with clear borders that highlight in blue on focus for feedback. The layout is centered, with a fixed width of 400px for readability, adhering to e-commerce standards for form design. These choices promote clarity, trust, and ease of use. -->

    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" link, typically found in the header or during checkout on the ShopEasy website. It may also be triggered as a modal or dedicated page when a user attempts to access account-specific features without logging in. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by entering their full name, email, and password into the respective fields, with real-time feedback via border highlights and error messages for invalid inputs. They can submit the form using the "Create Account" button, which disables during processing to prevent multiple submissions.
