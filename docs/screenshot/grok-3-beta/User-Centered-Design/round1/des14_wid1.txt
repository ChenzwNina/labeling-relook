    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean white background with a subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page with a 20px margin. It uses a green color scheme (#27ae60 for completed, #2ecc71 for active) to indicate progress, paired with neutral grays for inactive steps, enhancing visibility. The layout is centered with a wide status bar (80% width) for clarity, and elements like icons (40x40px) and text are sized for readability. These choices prioritize user-friendly feedback and consistency with e-commerce design standards, fostering trust and ease of use. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to the "My Orders" or "Order Tracking" section of the e-commerce website after logging into their account. It is triggered by selecting a specific order from their purchase history to view its status. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view order details (ID, dates) and track progress through a visual status bar with clear icons and labels. They can click the "View Detailed Tracking" button for more information, with hover feedback enhancing interaction. The button disables when no further details are available, preventing invalid actions. This ensures efficient and satisfying navigation of order status. -->
