    <!-- Question 1: The shopping cart widget has a clean, modern look with a white background, subtle gray borders, and a green (#4caf50) accent for buttons, reflecting trust and action. The cart is 350px wide with compact elements (50x50px images, 14px text) for clarity and space efficiency. Positioned at the top-right (20px margin), it ensures accessibility without obstructing content. These choices prioritize visibility, consistency, and a satisfying user experience aligned with e-commerce standards. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when users click the cart toggle button (a shopping cart icon) located at the top-right of the viewport. This trigger ensures easy access at any time during browsing, supporting efficient task execution. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the toggle button to open/close the cart, viewing item details (image, name, quantity, price), removing items via a clear "Remove" button with red color feedback, and proceeding to checkout with a prominent green button. Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback, enhancing affordances and preventing errors through constrained actions like item removal confirmation (assumed in full implementation). -->
