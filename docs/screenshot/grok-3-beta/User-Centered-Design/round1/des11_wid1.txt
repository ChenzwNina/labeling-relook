    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, centered layout with a white background container, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a modern look. It uses a red (#e74c3c) "Confirm Cancellation" button for urgency and a green (#2ecc71) "Keep Membership" button for positivity, ensuring clear visual hierarchy. Text is in grayscale for readability, with headers at 24px and body text at 16px. The design choice prioritizes simplicity and focus, guiding users to make informed decisions without distraction, adhering to high visibility and consistency. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user navigates to the membership cancellation section of their account settings on the ShopElite website, typically triggered by clicking a "Cancel Membership" link or button in their profile dashboard. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by selecting a cancellation reason from a dropdown menu, which is required to proceed. They can click "Confirm Cancellation" to finalize (with feedback confirmation) or "Keep Membership" to return to their account. Constraints like disabling the confirm button without a reason prevent invalid actions, and hover effects on buttons provide clear feedback. -->
