<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for the container and product cards, accented by a subtle shadow for depth. The color scheme includes a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons, ensuring high visibility. Product images are 200px tall for prominence, and the grid layout adjusts responsively with a minimum card width of 250px. Text sizes vary (24px for title, 18px for names, 16px for prices) for hierarchy. These choices prioritize clarity, consistency, and a professional e-commerce aesthetic while ensuring readability and focus on key actions like "Add to Cart." -->

<!-- Question 2: This widget appears on the main page of the e-commerce website or category pages as a default component to showcase featured or relevant products. It may also load dynamically based on user search queries, filters, or browsing history to display personalized product recommendations. -->

<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for visual feedback (lift effect and shadow), clicking on cards to view detailed product pages, and clicking "Add to Cart" buttons to purchase items. Buttons provide hover states and disable when items are out of stock, preventing invalid actions. Users can also scroll through the responsive grid to view multiple products efficiently. -->
