<!-- Question 1: The search panel is a fixed, full-width bar at the top with a 20px margin, featuring a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It centers a container (max 800px) with a category dropdown (light gray, 12px padding), a wide input field (16px font, blue focus border), and a blue search button (white text, hover darkens). These choices ensure visibility, a clean layout for focus, and consistent branding with blue accents for interactivity. -->
<!-- Question 2: The search panel is a persistent component, always visible at the top of the e-commerce website across all pages. It does not require a specific trigger to appear, as it is a core navigation tool for users to search for products at any time during their browsing experience. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by selecting a category from the dropdown to narrow their search, typing queries in the input field (limited to 100 characters), and clicking the search button to initiate a search. The button is disabled if no input is provided, preventing invalid actions. Hover effects on the button and dropdown, plus a focus outline on the input, provide feedback for user actions. -->
