    <!-- Question 1: The featured products widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a grid layout for responsiveness, with each product card having a consistent size (min 250px width). Colors include a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for price and buttons to draw attention, paired with neutral grays and blacks for text. Hover effects (lift and shadow) provide feedback. These choices ensure visibility, consistency, and a professional e-commerce aesthetic that encourages interaction. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears automatically at the top of the homepage, 20px from the viewport edge, as a key promotional element. It may also reload or update based on user filters, categories, or personalized recommendations triggered by browsing history or login data. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can hover over product cards for visual feedback (lift effect), click "Add to Cart" to purchase (with disabled state for out-of-stock items), and view product details by clicking the card. The design prevents invalid actions via disabled buttons and supports efficient browsing with clear, scannable layouts and consistent styling. -->
