    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel is a vertical sidebar fixed to the left of the viewport with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a clean, neutral color palette (white, grays, blue for the button) to ensure readability and focus on functionality. Elements like dropdowns, checkboxes, and the range slider are uniformly styled with consistent spacing (20px between sections, 8px within groups) and a compact width of 250px to avoid clutter. The blue 'Apply Filters' button stands out for action visibility. These choices prioritize clarity, usability, and a professional e-commerce aesthetic. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically when a user navigates to the product listing page of the e-commerce website. It remains fixed on the screen to ensure constant access to filtering options while browsing products, enhancing user control over search results. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by selecting a product category from a dropdown, adjusting a price range via a slider, checking/unchecking brand or rating options, and clicking the 'Apply Filters' button to update results. Hover effects on the button provide feedback, and disabled states prevent invalid actions. These interactions allow efficient and intuitive product filtering. -->
