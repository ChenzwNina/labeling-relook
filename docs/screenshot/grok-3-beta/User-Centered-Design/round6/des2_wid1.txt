<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle bottom border and shadow for depth, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page. Categories are displayed in a horizontal list, centered with equal spacing (30px gap on desktop, 15px on mobile), using a bold coral color (#ff6f61) for hover effects and underlines to provide feedback. Text is dark gray (#333333) for readability, with font sizes of 16px (desktop) and 14px (mobile) for accessibility. The fixed position with a 20px top margin ensures visibility. These choices promote a modern, uncluttered look consistent with e-commerce aesthetics, enhancing navigation efficiency. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically on page load, positioned at the top of the viewport as a persistent navigation bar. It remains fixed during scrolling to ensure constant access to product categories without needing user action to trigger its visibility. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact by hovering over category links, triggering color changes and underlines for feedback. Clicking a link navigates to the respective category section. The design prevents invalid actions by offering only predefined categories, ensuring clear affordances through hover effects and consistent styling across items. -->
