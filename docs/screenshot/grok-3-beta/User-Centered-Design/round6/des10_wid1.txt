    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a blue (#007bff) call-to-action button for high visibility, contrasting with neutral grays and greens for feedback. Text inputs are wide and padded for easy interaction, with a centered layout for focus. The size of elements like buttons and inputs is consistent (12px padding, 16px font), ensuring readability. These choices align with e-commerce aesthetics, promoting trust and usability while emphasizing the sign-up action. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears at the top of the homepage or during a user’s first visit to encourage membership sign-up. It could also trigger after a user adds items to their cart but isn’t logged in, prompting registration for benefits like free shipping. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can enter their email and password, with input validation ensuring proper formats (email, minimum password length). They can submit the form, receiving immediate feedback on success or error. Hover effects on the button provide visual cues, and the disabled state during submission prevents multiple clicks. Users can also read membership benefits for motivation. -->
