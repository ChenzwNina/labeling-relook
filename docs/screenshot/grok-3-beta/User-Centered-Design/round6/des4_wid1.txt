    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards, a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons, and a subtle gray (#f5f5f5) body background for contrast. Each card is 250px wide minimum, arranged in a responsive grid for adaptability. Text is legible with hierarchical sizing (2rem for header, 1.2rem for titles). Hover effects (lift and shadow) provide feedback. These choices ensure visibility, consistency, and a professional e-commerce look that guides users to key actions like adding to cart. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on the main page of the e-commerce website or specific category pages. It is triggered by default on page load to showcase featured or relevant products, ensuring users immediately see items for purchase without additional navigation. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for visual feedback (lift effect), clicking "Add to Cart" buttons to initiate a purchase, and viewing product details. Disabled buttons on out-of-stock items prevent invalid actions. These interactions are intuitive, efficient, and provide clear feedback through color changes and cursor states. -->
