    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page with a 20px margin. It uses a blue color scheme (#007bff) for the button, providing high visibility and a professional look. Input fields are spacious (350px form width, 10px padding) for easy interaction, with consistent rounded corners (4px). The layout is centered and vertically stacked for clarity. These choices enhance readability, usability, and align with e-commerce aesthetics, fostering trust. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" link, typically located in the header or during checkout on the ShopEase website. It serves as a dedicated page or modal for new user registration. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can enter their full name, email, and password, with real-time feedback on password mismatch via an error message. They can submit the form to create an account, receiving a success alert. Constraints like required fields and minimum password length prevent invalid submissions. Hover effects on the button and focus styles on inputs provide clear interaction cues. -->
