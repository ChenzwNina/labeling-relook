Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white product card (300px width) on a light gray background for contrast. The image (200px height) is prominently placed at the top, followed by a bold title (1.5em), vibrant price in orange ($129.99), and a subtle description in gray. The 'Add to Cart' button uses a striking orange (#e44d26) for visibility, with hover effects for feedback. These choices ensure a visually appealing, focused layout that highlights the product and encourages purchases.

Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or search result pages of an e-commerce website. It is triggered when a user navigates to a category or searches for items, displaying individual products as part of a grid or list layout.

Question 3: Users can interact by hovering over the card for a subtle lift effect, indicating interactivity. Clicking the 'Add to Cart' button adds the item to their cart with visual feedback (button color change). The design prevents invalid actions by limiting interactions to actionable elements, ensuring a clear and efficient user experience.
