    <!-- Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a green (#28a745) progress bar for active steps and gray (#ccc) for inactive ones, ensuring high visibility. Text uses a hierarchy with darker shades (#333) for emphasis and lighter (#666) for labels. The layout is centered with a max-width of 800px for readability, and elements like buttons and progress bars are sized for easy interaction. These choices enhance clarity, accessibility, and align with e-commerce aesthetics for trust and familiarity. -->
