<!-- Question 1: The order tracking widget has a clean, modern look with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a green progress bar (#2ecc71) for visibility of order status (60% complete). Text colors range from dark gray (#333) for headers to lighter gray (#777) for details, ensuring readability. The layout is centered with a max-width of 800px for responsiveness, and detail boxes are evenly spaced for clarity. These choices mimic e-commerce designs by prioritizing user-friendly, scannable information with a professional aesthetic. -->
<!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user logs into their account and has an active order, or when they click a "Track Order" link after purchase. It can also be triggered via a notification or dashboard update if the order status changes (e.g., from "Processing" to "Shipped"). -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the close button to dismiss it temporarily. They can view static details like order ID and status. If integrated with JavaScript (not included here), hovering over the progress bar could reveal status milestones, and clicking detail boxes might open detailed tracking pages or maps. -->
