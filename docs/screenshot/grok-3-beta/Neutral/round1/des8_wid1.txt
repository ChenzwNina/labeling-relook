<!-- Question 1: The shopping cart widget is positioned at the top-right with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a clean, modern look. It has a fixed width of 300px and a max height of 400px with scrollable content. Colors include green for the checkout button (#28a745) for positivity, red for remove buttons (#ff4444) for warning, and neutral grays (#333, #888) for text. The layout is vertical with a header, item list, and footer for clarity. These choices mimic real e-commerce designs, prioritizing accessibility and user familiarity. -->

    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when the user clicks the cart toggle button labeled "Cart (3)" at the top-right corner. This button is always visible, ensuring easy access. It could also be triggered programmatically when items are added to the cart (not implemented in this code) to provide immediate feedback. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the toggle button to open/close it, viewing cart items with images and prices, clicking "Remove" to delete items, and selecting "Proceed to Checkout" to finalize their purchase. Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback, enhancing usability. -->
