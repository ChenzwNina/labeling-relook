<!-- Question 1: The membership signup widget spans the full width of the viewport with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) for a clean, neutral look that fits e-commerce aesthetics. It features a centered layout with a bold heading in dark gray (#343a40) for emphasis, a descriptive paragraph in muted gray (#6c757d) for clarity, and a vibrant blue signup button (#007bff) to draw attention. The close button is positioned top-right for intuitive dismissal. A subtle box shadow adds depth. These choices ensure visibility, align with modern design trends, and encourage user engagement without being intrusive. -->

    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears at the top of the page on load, targeting new or non-member users. It could be triggered by user behavior, such as visiting the site for the first time, spending a certain amount of time browsing, or attempting to checkout without a membership, to maximize conversion opportunities. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the signup button to initiate the membership registration process, likely redirecting to a form or modal. They can also click the close button to dismiss the widget, hiding it temporarily or for the session. Hover effects on both buttons provide visual feedback, enhancing usability. -->
