    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a two-column layout for shipping options and add-ons, with each item in a light gray box for contrast. Colors like green (#27ae60) highlight prices and selections, aligning with common e-commerce branding for trust and positivity.

These choices ensure clarity, usability, and a professional look typical of e-commerce platforms. -->
