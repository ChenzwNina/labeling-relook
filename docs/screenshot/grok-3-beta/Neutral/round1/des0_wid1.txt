<!-- Question 1: The featured products widget uses a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards, a warm orange (#e44d26) for pricing and buttons to draw attention, and subtle gray shadows for depth. The layout is a responsive grid, adapting to screen size with a minimum card width of 250px. Text is dark gray (#333) for readability. Cards have a hover effect, lifting slightly for interactivity. These choices reflect typical e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity, visual hierarchy, and user engagement. -->

    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears statically at the top of the homepage with a 20px margin, as itâ€™s meant to showcase key products immediately upon page load. It could also be triggered dynamically on other pages based on user behavior, like returning visitors or specific category browsing, if integrated with JavaScript logic. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for a visual lift effect, indicating clickability. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase process. While not coded here, further interactions like clicking product images or titles for detailed views could be added with JavaScript, enhancing navigation and engagement. -->
