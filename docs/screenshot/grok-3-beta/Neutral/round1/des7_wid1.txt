    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. The layout is responsive, with rating cards adjusting from 3 to 2 to 1 per row on smaller screens. Colors include gold stars (#f1c40f) for ratings, dark gray (#333) for names, and light gray (#666) for text, ensuring readability and visual hierarchy. Cards are evenly spaced with a hover effect for interactivity. These choices mimic e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing trust and clarity. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears statically at the top of the page (with a 20px margin) as a permanent section on product or homepage views. It could also be triggered dynamically via a scroll event or linked to a "Reviews" section, depending on site design, to boost credibility early in the user journey. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over rating cards for a subtle lift effect, enhancing engagement. They can read detailed feedback and observe star ratings for quick insights. On touch devices, tapping cards could expand reviews (if extended functionality is added). Currently, itâ€™s primarily observational, building trust through social proof. -->
