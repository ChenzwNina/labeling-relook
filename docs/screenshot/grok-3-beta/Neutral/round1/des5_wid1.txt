    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel has a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadow for depth, and rounded corners for a friendly look. It uses a vibrant orange (#ff6200) for accents like checkboxes and the button to draw attention and align with common e-commerce branding. Text is in shades of gray for readability, with headings at 18px and options at 14px for hierarchy. The layout is flexible, using flexbox to adapt to different screen sizes, with categories side-by-side on desktop and stacked on mobile. These choices ensure usability and a professional aesthetic consistent with e-commerce platforms. -->

    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages, typically when a user navigates to a category or search results page. It can also be triggered by a user clicking a "Filter" button on smaller screens where it might be collapsed by default to save space. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by selecting/deselecting checkboxes for categories, price ranges, and brands to narrow down product results. Hovering over labels provides visual feedback with color changes. Clicking the "Apply Filters" button submits the selections to update the product list. On mobile, users might tap to expand/collapse the panel if implemented with a toggle. -->
