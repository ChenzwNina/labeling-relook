<!-- Question 1: The sign-in widget is a fixed header with a light gray background (#f8f8f8) for a clean, neutral look, blending seamlessly with typical e-commerce designs. The coral button (#ff6f61) stands out, encouraging clicks, and darkens on hover for feedback. Text is dark gray (#333) for readability, and elements are moderately sized (16px font, 10-20px padding) for clarity on all devices. The modal form is centered, compact (350px wide), with a white background and subtle shadow for focus. These choices ensure a professional, user-friendly interface aligned with e-commerce aesthetics. -->

    <!-- Question 2: The widget is always visible at the top of the page as a fixed header to ensure easy access to the sign-in feature. The modal appears when the user clicks the "Sign In" button, providing a focused area for entering credentials without navigating away from the current page. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the "Sign In" button to open the modal, entering their email and password in the form fields, and submitting the form to log in. They can click the overlay to close the modal, access a "Forgot Password?" link for recovery, or click "Register now" to create an account. Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback. -->
