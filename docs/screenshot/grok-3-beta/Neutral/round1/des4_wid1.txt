<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards, a subtle shadow for depth, and a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention. The layout uses a responsive grid with cards of at least 250px width, ensuring adaptability across devices. Product images are 200px tall for prominence, while text is sized hierarchically (title 24px, product name 18px, price 16px) for readability. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing visual appeal and user navigation. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on the homepage or category pages of the e-commerce site, triggered by the page load event. It could also be dynamically loaded based on user search queries or filters applied through a sidebar or navigation menu. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for a subtle lift effect, visually indicating interactivity. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase process. Additionally, clicking on product images or names could potentially link to detailed product pages (though not implemented in this static HTML). -->
