    <!-- Question 1: The product card has a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadow for depth, and rounded corners for a friendly feel. The image takes up a significant portion (200px height) for visual appeal, while the title (1.2rem) and price (1.1rem, orange for emphasis) are prominent. The layout is centered with a fixed width of 300px for consistency across devices. I chose a hover effect (slight lift) to indicate interactivity, and orange (#e44d26) for the price and button to evoke urgency and attract attention, mimicking common e-commerce design trends for conversion optimization. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as part of a product detail view. It is triggered when a user navigates to a category page, searches for items, or clicks on a specific product link within the e-commerce website, displaying relevant product information dynamically. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the card for a visual lift effect, clicking the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase, and potentially clicking the image or title (if linked) to view detailed product information. These interactions facilitate browsing, engagement, and conversion in the shopping process. -->
