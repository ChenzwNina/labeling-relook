    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, mimicking e-commerce aesthetics like Amazon or Shopify. The container is centered with a max-width of 400px for readability. Inputs have a light gray border (#ddd) for contrast, and the button uses a vibrant coral (#ff6f61) to draw attention, with a hover effect for interactivity. Text sizes (24px for headings, 16px for inputs) ensure hierarchy and accessibility. These choices create a professional, user-friendly look that builds trust. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on a 'Sign Up' or 'Create Account' link, typically located in the header or during checkout on the e-commerce site. It could also be triggered as a modal or dedicated page when a user attempts to access account-specific features without logging in. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by entering their full name, email, and password in the respective fields, confirming the password, and clicking the 'Create Account' button to submit. They can also click on links to view the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. If integrated with JavaScript (not included), error messages for invalid inputs or successful registration notifications would enhance interaction. -->
