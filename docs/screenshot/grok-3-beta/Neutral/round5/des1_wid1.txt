<!-- Question 1: The deals banner spans the full width of the viewport with a vibrant gradient background transitioning from coral (#ff6f61) to peach (#ffb88c), chosen to grab attention and evoke excitement for sales. The text is white, bold, and uppercase (18px on desktop, 16px on mobile) for readability and urgency. A centered white button with coral text (16px) contrasts the background, encouraging clicks, with a hover effect for interactivity. The layout uses flexbox for alignment, with a close button on the right for dismissal. These choices mimic modern e-commerce designs, prioritizing visibility and action. -->
<!-- Question 2: The banner appears automatically when a user loads the website, positioned fixed at the top with a 20px margin to ensure prominence. It may also reappear during specific promotional events or based on user behavior, like returning after a session timeout, triggered by backend logic or timers. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the banner by clicking the 'Shop Now' button to navigate to the deals page, hovering over the button for a visual feedback effect, or clicking the close button ('Ã—') to dismiss the banner temporarily. These interactions cater to both engagement and user control. -->
