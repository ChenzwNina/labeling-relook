Question 1: The product card widget features a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle gray borders, and a slight shadow for depth. The image is 200px tall, ensuring visual prominence, while the title (18px, bold) and price (20px, orange) stand out for emphasis. The description text is smaller (14px, gray) for hierarchy. The layout is centered with a 300px width for focus and responsiveness. The orange 'Add to Cart' button matches the price color for cohesion. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and visual appeal to drive purchases.

Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or search result pages of an e-commerce website. It is triggered by user navigation to these sections or by searching for specific items, dynamically loading individual product data from a database or API based on the context of the page.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the card for a subtle lift effect, enhancing engagement. They can click the 'Add to Cart' button to initiate a purchase, potentially triggering a cart update or modal confirmation. Additionally, clicking the image or title might redirect to a detailed product page for more information.
