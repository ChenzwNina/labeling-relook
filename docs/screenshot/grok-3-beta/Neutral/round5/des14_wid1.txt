<!-- Question 1: The order tracking widget features a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle gray borders, and a soft shadow for elevation. It uses a green dot to indicate active status, blue for the interactive button, and neutral grays for text to ensure readability. The layout is centered with a fixed position at the top (20px margin), spanning 90% of the viewport width (max 800px). Elements are sized for clarity—header at 1.5rem, details at 1rem/0.9rem. These choices mimic e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing user focus on tracking info while ensuring responsiveness on smaller screens. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user has an active order after logging into their account on the e-commerce website. It is triggered by the system detecting an order in progress (e.g., placed, shipped, or in transit) and remains visible on relevant pages like the homepage or order history until the order is delivered or the user dismisses it. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the "View Full Details" button, which redirects to a detailed tracking page. Hovering over the button provides visual feedback with a darker blue shade. On smaller screens, the layout adjusts for better readability. Currently, there’s no dismissal option, but users indirectly control visibility by completing or canceling orders. -->
