    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel is a fixed sidebar on the left with a white background, subtle gray borders, and a slight shadow for depth. It uses a clean, minimalistic color scheme with blue for the 'Apply Filters' button to draw attention. Text sizes are kept small (14px for options, 18px for headings) for readability, and the layout is vertically stacked for easy scanning. These choices mimic modern e-commerce designs, prioritizing usability and clarity over clutter, ensuring users can filter products effortlessly. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically when a user navigates to a product listing page on the e-commerce website. It remains visible and fixed to the top-left of the viewport (with a 20px margin) as the user scrolls, ensuring constant access to filtering options without needing to trigger it manually. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by checking/unchecking filter options for categories and price ranges using checkboxes. Hovering over labels provides visual feedback with a color change. Clicking the 'Apply Filters' button submits the selected filters, updating the product list. The panel remains fixed, allowing interaction at any scroll position without additional clicks to open or close it. -->
