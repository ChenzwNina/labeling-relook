    <!-- Question 1: The featured products widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. The layout uses a responsive grid with cards (250px minimum width) to display products, ensuring adaptability across devices. Colors include a bold orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention, paired with neutral grays and blacks for text and borders for readability. Product images are 200px tall for visibility, and hover effects (lift and shadow) enhance interactivity. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and user engagement. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears statically at the top of the homepage (20px margin from top) as a key promotional element. Itâ€™s triggered on page load to immediately showcase popular or trending items, ensuring users see high-value products without scrolling. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for a visual lift effect, clicking "Add to Cart" buttons to initiate a purchase, and viewing product details like name and price. The design supports potential future enhancements like clicking images or names for product pages, though currently, interaction is limited to cart addition. -->
