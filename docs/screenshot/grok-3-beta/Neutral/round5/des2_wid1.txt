<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle box shadow for elevation, mimicking popular e-commerce sites like Amazon. The navigation items are centered with a max-width of 1200px for readability on larger screens. Text is dark gray (#333) for contrast, turning orange (#e44d26) on hover with an animated underline effect for interactivity. Font size is 16px for clarity, and spacing between items (20px) ensures a non-cluttered look. These choices enhance usability and align with professional, user-friendly design standards. -->
<!-- Question 2: This widget appears persistently at the top of the page (20px margin) as a fixed navigation bar. It is visible on all pages of the e-commerce site to provide constant access to product categories, triggered by the page load and unaffected by user actions like scrolling. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over category links, which triggers a color change and underline animation for visual feedback. Clicking a link navigates to the respective category page (e.g., Electronics). The widget is accessible via keyboard navigation for tabbing through links, ensuring inclusivity. No additional interactions like dropdowns are included to maintain simplicity. -->
