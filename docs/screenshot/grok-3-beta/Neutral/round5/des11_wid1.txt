Question 1: The widget has a clean, centered layout with a white background, subtle border, and shadow for a professional look, mimicking e-commerce design standards. The red (#d32f2f) heading and confirm button emphasize the seriousness of cancellation, while neutral grays (#f0f0f0, #e0e0e0) for the cancel button provide contrast. Text is sized at 16px for readability, and the heading at 24px for hierarchy. Buttons are evenly spaced with hover effects for interactivity. These choices ensure clarity and urgency while maintaining a user-friendly, familiar aesthetic.

Question 2: This widget appears when a user navigates to the membership settings page or selects a "Cancel Membership" option from their account dashboard. It may also trigger as a modal popup after a user confirms their intent to cancel via a preliminary prompt, ensuring they are fully aware of the consequences before finalizing the action.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by reading the cancellation warning, then choosing between two buttons: "Yes, Cancel Membership" to proceed with cancellation, or "No, Keep Membership" to dismiss the widget and retain their subscription. Hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback, enhancing usability. If integrated with JavaScript (not included here), clicking "Yes" might trigger a confirmation or redirect, while "No" closes the widget.
