<!-- Question 1: The search panel is a fixed, full-width component positioned 20px from the top with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It features a centered search bar (80% width, max 600px) with a light gray border, a blue search button for contrast, and a category dropdown for filtering. The input and button have rounded corners for a modern look, and the blue color (#007bff) aligns with common e-commerce branding for trust and action. The design prioritizes accessibility and visibility, ensuring users can search effortlessly. -->
<!-- Question 2: The search panel appears persistently at the top of the viewport on every page of the e-commerce website. It is a core navigation tool, always visible to facilitate quick product searches without needing to scroll or navigate to a specific section. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by typing queries into the search input, which activates focus styling for feedback. They can click the search button to submit their query or press Enter. The category dropdown allows filtering by product type, enhancing search precision. Hover effects on the button and dropdown provide visual cues, improving usability. -->
