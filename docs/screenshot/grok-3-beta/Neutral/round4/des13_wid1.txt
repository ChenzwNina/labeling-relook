<!-- Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern look with a light gray (#f8f8f8) background for a subtle header feel, common in e-commerce sites. The text is dark gray (#333) for readability, and the button is a vibrant coral (#ff6f61) to draw attention as a call-to-action, with a hover effect darkening to #e55a50 for interactivity. The layout is aligned to the right on desktop for a non-intrusive header placement, centered on mobile for usability. Text and button sizes (16px) ensure clarity, and padding (10px-20px) provides comfortable spacing. These choices balance functionality with visual appeal, mimicking professional e-commerce designs. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears statically at the top of the page on load, as it’s a persistent header element meant to encourage user sign-in for personalized experiences. It’s always visible to remind users of account benefits like exclusive deals or order tracking, typical for e-commerce platforms. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the "Sign In" button, which would typically redirect to a login page or open a modal for credentials entry (not implemented in this static code). Hovering over the button triggers a color change for visual feedback. There are no other direct interactions, keeping the design simple and focused on prompting account access. -->
