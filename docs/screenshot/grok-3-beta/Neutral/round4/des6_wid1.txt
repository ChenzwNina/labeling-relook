    <!-- Question 1: The product card has a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadow for depth, and rounded corners for a polished look. The image takes up a significant portion (200px height) for visual appeal, while the title (1.5rem) and price (1.2rem, red for emphasis) are prominent. The description is smaller (0.9rem) to avoid clutter. The orange 'Add to Cart' button matches the price color for consistency and stands out. These choices mimic e-commerce standards, prioritizing clarity, visual hierarchy, and user engagement. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as part of a product detail page within an e-commerce website. It is triggered by the page load when a user navigates to a category or searches for items, displaying individual products dynamically based on the catalog data. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the card for a slight lift effect, indicating interactivity. They can click the 'Add to Cart' button to add the item to their shopping cart, potentially triggering a confirmation or cart update. Additionally, clicking the image or title could redirect to a detailed product page for more information. -->
