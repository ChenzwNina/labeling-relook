<!-- Question 1: The order tracking widget is a fixed bar at the top of the viewport with a 20px margin, featuring a clean white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a green status icon (#4CAF50) for visibility, a blue button (#007BFF) for action emphasis, and neutral text colors (#333, #666) for readability. The layout is responsive, centered within a 1200px wrapper, with elements spaced evenly for clarity. Font sizes (18px for headings, 14px for details) ensure hierarchy. These choices mimic modern e-commerce designs, prioritizing usability and brand consistency. -->
<!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user has an active order with a status like "In Transit" or "Shipped." It is triggered post-purchase, typically after the order is confirmed and shipped, based on backend data updates. It remains visible on all pages until delivery or a set timeout. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the "View Details" button to access a detailed order tracking page. Hovering over the button changes its color for feedback. The status icon and "Track Your Package" text are non-interactive but provide visual cues. Users may also see updates to text (e.g., delivery status) dynamically. -->
