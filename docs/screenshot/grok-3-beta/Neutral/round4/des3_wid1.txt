    <!-- Question 1: The search panel is a fixed bar at the top with a 20px margin, featuring a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It spans the full width for accessibility, with a centered search container (60% width, max 600px) for balance. The input field is wide with a soft border, paired with a coral (#ff6f61) search button for vibrancy and contrast, reflecting e-commerce energy. The category dropdown is compact, styled in light gray for hierarchy. These choices ensure usability, visibility, and a modern, inviting look aligned with e-commerce trends. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The search panel is a persistent element, visible on every page of the e-commerce website. It appears immediately upon page load and remains fixed at the top to ensure users can access search functionality at any time without scrolling, enhancing navigation efficiency. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by typing queries in the search input field, selecting a category from the dropdown to narrow results, and clicking the search button to initiate the search. Hovering over the button triggers a color shift for feedback. The input supports keyboard navigation (e.g., Enter key to search), and the dropdown allows category selection via click or keyboard, ensuring accessibility and a seamless search experience. -->
