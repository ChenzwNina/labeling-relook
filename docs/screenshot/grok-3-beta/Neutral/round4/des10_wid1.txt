Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) for a subtle, professional look. The header is bold (24px) and dark (#343a40) for emphasis, while the description text is lighter (#6c757d) for hierarchy. The signup button is a vibrant blue (#007bff) to draw attention, with a hover effect for interactivity. Benefits are displayed in a centered flex layout with icons (50x50px) for visual appeal. These choices align with e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and user engagement.

Question 2: This widget appears at the top of the homepage or key landing pages to maximize visibility. It could be triggered on page load for new or non-logged-in users, or after a user scrolls past a certain point (e.g., 50% of the page) to re-engage them. It might also appear during a promotional campaign.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by reading the benefits of membership, visually reinforced by icons. They can click the "Sign Up Now" button to initiate registration, likely redirecting to a signup form or modal. Hover effects on the button provide feedback, enhancing the user experience.
