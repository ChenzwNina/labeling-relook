    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadows, and rounded corners for a professional look typical of e-commerce sites. Shipping options and add-ons are displayed in card layouts using a grid for responsiveness. Colors include blue (#007bff) for interactive elements and borders to draw attention, with neutral grays for text to ensure readability. Font sizes are hierarchical (1.5rem for titles, 1.1rem for subtitles) to guide users visually. These choices mimic familiar e-commerce aesthetics, enhancing trust and usability. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears during the checkout process, typically after users have added items to their cart and are finalizing their order. It is triggered when the user navigates to the shipping or payment page, ensuring they can select delivery preferences and optional services before completing the purchase. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking on shipping option cards to select their preferred delivery speed, with visual feedback (blue border and background) indicating the choice. They can also toggle checkboxes for add-ons like gift wrapping or insurance, allowing multiple selections. Hover effects on cards and items provide additional feedback, enhancing the user experience. -->
