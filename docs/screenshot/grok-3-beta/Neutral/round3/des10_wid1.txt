<!-- Question 1: The membership signup widget spans the full width of the page with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) for a clean, neutral look, fitting an e-commerce aesthetic. It features a centered layout with a bold heading (24px) in dark gray (#343a40) and a descriptive paragraph (16px) in lighter gray (#6c757d) for hierarchy. Three benefit cards are evenly spaced, each with a small placeholder image (50x50px) and concise text. The signup button is coral (#ff6f61), drawing attention as the primary action, with a hover effect for interactivity. These choices ensure a professional, inviting design that highlights benefits and encourages signups. -->
<!-- Question 2: This widget appears at the top of the homepage or key landing pages, visible to all users upon page load. It may also reappear via a scroll-triggered event (e.g., after scrolling 50% of the page) or as a popup for non-members after a short delay to maximize visibility and engagement. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by reading the membership benefits for information, hovering over the signup button for a visual feedback effect, and clicking the button to initiate the signup process, likely redirecting to a registration form or modal. No other direct interactions are included, keeping the focus on conversion. -->
