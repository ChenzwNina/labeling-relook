    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards, a subtle shadow for depth, and a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention. The grid layout adapts to screen size, ensuring responsiveness, with each card at least 250px wide. Product images are 200px tall for consistency, and text is sized hierarchically (24px title, 18px product name, 16px price) for readability. These choices mimic real e-commerce sites like Amazon, prioritizing clarity and visual appeal to encourage purchases. -->

    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on the homepage or category pages of the e-commerce site as a default component. It is triggered upon page load to showcase featured or popular products, ensuring users immediately see items of interest without additional interaction. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for a subtle lift effect, enhancing engagement. Clicking the "Add to Cart" button allows adding items to their shopping cart.
