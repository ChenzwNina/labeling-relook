Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern look with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, mimicking e-commerce aesthetics. It uses a coral color (#ff6f61) for the CTA button and checkmarks, creating a vibrant, inviting feel that encourages action. The heading is 24px for emphasis, while text is 16px and 14px for readability. The layout is centered for focus, with a max-width container of 1200px for responsiveness. These choices align with user-friendly, conversion-driven design seen on platforms like Amazon or Shopify.

Question 2: This widget appears at the top of the homepage or during checkout for unauthenticated users. It can also trigger after a user browses for a set time (e.g., 30 seconds) or attempts to access restricted features like wishlists, prompting account creation for a seamless experience.

Question 3: Users can interact by clicking the "Create Account" button, which redirects to a registration form. Hovering over the button changes its color for visual feedback. While the widget itself doesn’t offer input fields, it serves as an entry point to the sign-up process, potentially opening a modal or new page for further interaction.
