Question 1: The deals banner is positioned at the top with a 20px margin, spanning the full width of the viewport. It features a vibrant gradient background transitioning from coral (#ff6f61) to orange (#ff8e53) to grab attention. The text is white, bold, and 18px for readability, while the "Shop Now" button is white with coral text (16px) for contrast. The layout is centered with flexbox for balance, and a subtle shadow adds depth. These choices mimic e-commerce urgency and vibrancy, encouraging clicks.

Question 2: The banner appears automatically on page load, typically triggered by active promotions or time-sensitive sales events. It could also be triggered by user behavior, like visiting specific product categories (e.g., electronics) or during seasonal sales like Black Friday, managed via backend logic or JavaScript.

Question 3: Users can interact with the banner by clicking the "Shop Now" button, which would redirect to a deals page or specific product category. Hovering over the button changes its background for visual feedback. On mobile, the layout adapts to a stacked view for usability, maintaining clickability.
