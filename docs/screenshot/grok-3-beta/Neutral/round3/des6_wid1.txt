    <!-- Question 1: The product item widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for a card-like effect, mimicking popular e-commerce platforms. It uses a 300px width for balanced spacing, a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for price and button to draw attention, and grayscale tones for text to ensure readability. The image takes up significant space (200px height) to highlight the product visually. A hover effect lifts the card for interactivity. These choices create a professional, user-friendly look that encourages purchases. -->

    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or search result pages of an e-commerce website. It is triggered by the page load when a user navigates to a category or searches for items, dynamically populated with data from a database based on user queries or predefined categories. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the card for a visual lift effect, clicking the product image or title to view detailed product pages, and clicking the "Add to Cart" button to add the item to their shopping cart. These interactions facilitate browsing and purchasing, aligning with typical e-commerce user flows. -->
