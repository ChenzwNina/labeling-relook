<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalistic design with a white background (#ffffff) and a subtle shadow for elevation. Text is dark gray (#333333) for readability, with an orange accent color (#e44d26) for hover and active states to draw attention. Categories are centered in a horizontal list with equal spacing (20px margins), and font size is 16px for clarity. The design choices ensure a professional, user-friendly look typical of e-commerce sites, prioritizing accessibility and visual hierarchy. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears statically at the top of the page with a 20px margin, fixed in position to remain visible while scrolling. It is triggered on page load as a primary navigation tool, ensuring users can always access key product categories without additional actions. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over category links, which change color and display an underline for feedback. Clicking a link navigates to the respective category page. The active state visually indicates the current category. No additional interactions like dropdowns are included, keeping the navigation simple and intuitive for quick access. -->
