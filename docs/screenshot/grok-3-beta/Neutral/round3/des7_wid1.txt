    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a light gray background (#f9f9f9) for the container with white rating cards for contrast, creating a clean, modern look typical of e-commerce sites. The title is 24px for prominence, summaries are 18px, and review text is 14px for readability. Star ratings are in gold (#f39c12) to draw attention. The layout uses a centered flexbox for responsiveness, with cards at 300px width for balance. These choices mimic popular platforms like Amazon, ensuring familiarity and trust. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product detail pages, typically below the product description or near the purchase button. It is triggered by the page load of a specific product, ensuring users see social proof before making a purchase decision. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can read individual reviews and see the overall rating for a quick summary. While this static version lacks interactivity, in a dynamic implementation, users could click to expand more reviews, filter by star rating, or submit their own feedback via a form linked to the widget. Hover effects on cards could also highlight specific reviews for better engagement. -->
