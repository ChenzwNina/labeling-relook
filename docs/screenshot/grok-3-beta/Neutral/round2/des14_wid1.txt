    <!-- Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a green (#4CAF50) color for completed tracking stages and gray (#ccc) for incomplete ones, providing clear visual contrast. The layout is responsive, adapting to smaller screens by stacking elements vertically. Font sizes (24px for header, 16px for details) ensure readability, and the coral button (#ff6f61) draws attention for interaction. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and user-friendliness. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to their order history or tracking page after logging into their account on the e-commerce website. It may also display on a dedicated order confirmation page post-purchase or when a tracking link is accessed via email. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the "View Order Details" button, which could redirect to a detailed order page with itemized lists and tracking updates. On hover, the button changes color for visual feedback. While the tracking status is static in this design, in a dynamic implementation, users might click status points for specific updates or timestamps. -->
