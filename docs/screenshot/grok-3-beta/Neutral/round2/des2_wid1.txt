    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle box shadow for elevation, mimicking modern e-commerce designs. The layout is horizontal, using flexbox for even spacing, with a max-width of 1200px for readability. Text uses a neutral color palette (#333, #555) for clarity, with a vibrant orange (#e44d26) on hover for interactivity, reflecting common brand accents. Font sizes (18px for title, 16px for links) ensure hierarchy and accessibility. These choices prioritize usability and familiarity for e-commerce users. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears statically at the top of the page with a 20px margin, remaining sticky as users scroll for constant access to navigation. It loads with the page and does not require specific user actions or events to trigger its visibility, ensuring immediate category access. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over category links or the "View All" button, which changes color for visual feedback. Clicking any link navigates to the respective category page or full category list. The sticky positioning ensures it remains accessible during scrolling, enhancing navigation efficiency across the site. -->
