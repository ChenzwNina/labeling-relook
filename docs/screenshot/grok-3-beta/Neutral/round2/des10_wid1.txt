<!-- Question 1: The membership sign-up widget is a fixed bar at the top of the viewport with a 20px margin. It features a vibrant gradient background transitioning from coral (#ff6f61) to orange (#ff8e53) to grab attention. The text is white for contrast, with a bold 1.5rem headline and 1rem description for hierarchy. The sign-up button is white with coral text, providing a striking call-to-action, and includes hover effects for interactivity. A close button (×) is positioned on the right for dismissal. These choices mimic e-commerce designs that prioritize visibility and urgency. -->
<!-- Question 2: This widget appears when a user visits the website for the first time or hasn’t signed up for membership yet. It could be triggered by a session cookie check or after a short delay (e.g., 5 seconds) to ensure the user notices it without immediate intrusion. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget in two ways: clicking the “Sign Up Now” button, which would redirect them to a membership registration page, or clicking the close button to dismiss the bar temporarily. Hovering over the sign-up button triggers a subtle scale and color change for visual feedback. -->
