    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a grid layout for product cards, each with a 250px minimum width, ensuring responsiveness. Colors include a bold orange (#e44d26) for price and button elements to draw attention, paired with neutral grays for text and borders for readability. Product images are 200px tall for consistency, and hover effects (lift and shadow) enhance interactivity. These choices reflect typical e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and visual appeal to encourage purchases. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears statically at the top of the homepage with a 20px margin, as itâ€™s meant to showcase featured products immediately upon page load. It could also be triggered dynamically via a CMS to display curated or trending items based on user behavior or sales data, though this implementation is static for simplicity. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for a visual lift effect, indicating clickability. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase process. In a full implementation, clicking images or titles could link to product pages for detailed views, though this is not coded here. -->
