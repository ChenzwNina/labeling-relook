    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth, mimicking e-commerce aesthetics. It uses a blue color scheme (#007bff) for prices and buttons to draw attention and evoke trust. Cards for shipping options and add-ons have a consistent layout with clear typography (bold titles at 1.1rem, descriptions at 0.9rem) for readability. The container spans full width with 90% inner content width for balance. These choices ensure a professional, user-friendly experience aligned with e-commerce standards. -->
