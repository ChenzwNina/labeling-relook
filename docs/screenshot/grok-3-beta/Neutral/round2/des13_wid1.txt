Question 1: The sign-in widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, mimicking typical e-commerce aesthetics. It uses a blue color scheme (#007bff) for buttons and links to evoke trust and interactivity. The form width is fixed at 350px for readability, centered for focus, with input fields and buttons having rounded corners (4px) for a friendly feel. Text sizes vary (24px for title, 16px for inputs) to establish hierarchy. These choices ensure a professional, user-friendly interface consistent with e-commerce platforms.

Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign In" link or button in the website header, typically located in the navigation bar. It may also trigger automatically if a user attempts to access restricted features like checkout or account settings without being logged in, redirecting them to this form.

Question 3: Users can interact by entering their email and password in the respective fields, clicking the "Sign In" button to log in, selecting "Forgot Password?" to reset credentials, or clicking "Create an Account" to register. Hover effects on buttons and links provide visual feedback, and input fields highlight on focus for better usability.
