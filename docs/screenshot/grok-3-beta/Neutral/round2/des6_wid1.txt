    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white product card on a light gray background for contrast. The card is 300px wide with a subtle shadow and rounded corners for a polished look. The image (200px height) dominates the top, followed by a bold black title (1.2rem), a striking red price (1.1rem), and a gray description (0.9rem) for hierarchy. The orange "Add to Cart" button stands out for action. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity, visual appeal, and user focus on key elements like price and action. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as a featured item on the homepage of the e-commerce site. It is triggered by page load or when a user navigates to a category or search results page displaying individual products. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the card for a subtle lift effect, indicating interactivity. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to add the item to their shopping cart, potentially triggering a confirmation modal or animation. Additionally, clicking the product image or title may redirect to a detailed product page for more information. -->
