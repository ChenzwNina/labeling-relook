<!-- Question 1: The filter panel has a clean, modern look with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, mimicking e-commerce site aesthetics. It uses a blue (#007bff) accent for checkboxes and the apply button, ensuring visual consistency and brand alignment. Text is dark gray for readability, with headings slightly larger (18px) for hierarchy. The layout is flexible with a responsive design, wrapping sections on smaller screens, and has a max-width of 1200px to maintain balance. These choices enhance usability and familiarity for users. -->

<!-- Question 3: Users can interact by selecting checkboxes for categories and brands to narrow down products, adjusting the price range slider to set budget limits, and clicking the 'Apply Filters' button to update the product list. Hover effects on the button provide feedback, enhancing the experience. -->
