    <!-- Question 1: The shopping cart widget is positioned at the top-right corner with a white background, subtle border, and shadow for a clean, modern look. It has a fixed width of 350px and a max height of 400px with a scrollable overflow for multiple items. The color scheme uses a coral red (#ff6f61) for the checkout button to draw attention, paired with neutral grays for borders. Items are displayed in a flex layout for alignment, with images at 50x50px for clarity. These choices mimic e-commerce designs by prioritizing accessibility and visual hierarchy, ensuring users can quickly review their cart. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when the user clicks the cart icon (ðŸ›’) located at the top-right corner of the page. This trigger is intuitive as it aligns with common e-commerce UX patterns where users expect cart access via an icon. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the cart icon to open/close it, viewing item details (image, name, quantity, price), scrolling if there are many items, and clicking the "Proceed to Checkout" button to complete their purchase. These interactions cover typical cart functionalities on e-commerce sites. -->
