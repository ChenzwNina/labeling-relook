<!-- Question 1: The widget is a fixed bar at the top of the page with a 20px margin, featuring a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. It uses a centered layout with a gold star rating (★★★★★), dark gray text for readability, and a blue call-to-action button for contrast. The font sizes (20px for stars, 16px for main text, 14px for details) ensure hierarchy. These choices mimic modern e-commerce design, prioritizing clarity and user engagement while maintaining a clean, professional look. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically on product pages or after a user completes a purchase, triggered by page load or a backend event like order confirmation. It can also display when a user scrolls to the reviews section, prompted by JavaScript scroll events, to encourage feedback. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the "Leave a Review" button, which redirects to a review submission form. Hovering over the button changes its shade for visual feedback. While the stars and text are static for summary display, future enhancements could allow clicking stars to filter reviews or view detailed ratings breakdowns. -->
