    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background container and subtle shadows for depth. Each rating card uses a light gray background (#f9f9f9) for contrast, with gold stars (#f39c12) for ratings to draw attention. Text sizes vary—24px for the title, 16px for usernames, and 14px for comments—to create hierarchy. The layout is responsive, stacking cards on smaller screens. These choices mimic e-commerce sites like Amazon, prioritizing readability and trust through clear, organized feedback. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product pages or a dedicated reviews section of an e-commerce site. It is triggered automatically when a user navigates to a specific product or scrolls to the reviews area, often placed below product details to encourage purchase decisions based on social proof. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view detailed reviews, including ratings, comments, and dates, to assess product quality. While this static version lacks interactivity, a dynamic implementation could allow sorting by rating or date, submitting personal reviews, or clicking usernames to view profiles. Hover effects on cards could highlight them, enhancing engagement. -->
