Question 1: The sign-in widget features a clean, minimalistic design with a white background and subtle gray border, mimicking typical e-commerce aesthetics like Amazon. The container is centered with a width of 350px for focus, using a soft shadow for depth. Inputs have a light gray border for clarity, and the orange sign-in button (#ff9900) provides a vibrant, actionable contrast, darkening on hover for feedback. Text is dark gray for readability, and links are blue for familiarity. These choices ensure trust and usability.

Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign In" link or button in the website’s header, or when attempting to access account-specific features like order history or checkout without being logged in. It may also display automatically if a session expires.

Question 3: Users can interact by entering their email and password in the input fields, clicking the "Sign In" button to authenticate, or using the "Forgot Password?" link to reset credentials. They can also click "Create an Account" to register. The widget provides hover effects on the button and links for visual feedback, ensuring intuitive navigation.
