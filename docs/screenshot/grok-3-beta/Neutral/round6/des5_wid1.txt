    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel has a light gray background (#f8f8f8) for a clean, neutral look, with a subtle shadow for depth. It’s 250px wide, fixed on the left side, with a 20px top margin for positioning. Text sizes are hierarchical—18px for the title, 14px for category headings, and 13px for options—to ensure readability. The blue "Apply Filters" button (#007bff) stands out for action. These choices mimic e-commerce designs by prioritizing clarity and usability, ensuring filters are accessible without overwhelming the page. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically when a user navigates to the product listing page of the e-commerce site. It remains visible and fixed in position as the user scrolls, ensuring constant access to filtering options without needing to trigger it manually. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by checking/unchecking filter options for categories and price ranges, allowing multiple selections. Hovering over labels provides visual feedback with color changes. Clicking the "Apply Filters" button updates the product list based on selected criteria. The panel remains static, with no collapse or drag functionality, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. -->
