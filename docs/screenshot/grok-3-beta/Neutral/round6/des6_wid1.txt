    <!-- Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background for the product card, a subtle shadow for depth, and a hover effect for interactivity. The image takes up the top 200px, ensuring visual prominence, while text elements use a hierarchy of sizes (1.2em for title, 0.9em for description) for readability. Colors include a neutral palette (#333, #666) for text and a bold orange (#e44d26) for price and button to draw attention. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and conversion-focused design. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as part of a product grid on an e-commerce website. It is triggered by the page load or when a user navigates to a category or search results page displaying multiple products. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the card for a subtle lift effect, visually indicating interactivity. They can click the product image or title (if linked) to view detailed product information and click the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase, potentially triggering a confirmation or cart update animation. -->
