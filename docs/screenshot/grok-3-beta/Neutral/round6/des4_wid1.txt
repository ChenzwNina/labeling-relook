    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a grid layout for product cards, using a max-width of 1200px for responsiveness. Each card has a subtle border, hover shadow effect for interactivity, and consistent spacing (20px gap). Colors include a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for price and buttons to draw attention, gold (#f1c40f) for ratings for visibility, and neutral grays for text and borders for readability. Images are 200px tall for uniformity. These choices mimic real e-commerce aesthetics, prioritizing clarity and visual appeal to encourage purchases. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears on page load as a core component of the e-commerce site, typically on the homepage or category pages. It may also refresh or filter based on user actions like searching or selecting a product category, dynamically updating the displayed items. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over product cards for a shadow effect, clicking product images or names to view detailed pages (assumed functionality), and clicking "Add to Cart" buttons to initiate a purchase. They may also scroll through the grid if more products are loaded dynamically. -->
