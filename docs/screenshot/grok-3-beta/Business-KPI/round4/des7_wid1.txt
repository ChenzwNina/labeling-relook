    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for a professional look, positioned 20px from the top. It uses a centered layout with a grid of three review cards, each with gold stars (#f1c40f) for ratings, dark text for readability, and a red CTA button (#e74c3c) to grab attention. Cards are 280px wide with hover effects for interactivity. These choices build trust through social proof, encourage engagement with a bold CTA, and enhance visual appeal to reduce bounce rates and increase conversions. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears statically at the top of the homepage or product pages to immediately showcase customer feedback. Itâ€™s always visible to build trust early in the user journey, especially for new visitors, maximizing its impact on sales and time on site. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can read detailed reviews and ratings within the cards, hover over cards for a subtle lift effect to encourage interaction, and click the "Shop Now" CTA button to navigate to the product catalog. These interactions drive engagement, reduce cart abandonment, and increase conversion rates by reinforcing trust and prompting purchases. -->
