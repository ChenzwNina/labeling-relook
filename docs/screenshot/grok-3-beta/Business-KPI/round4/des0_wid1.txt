    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, white background with subtle shadows for depth, ensuring a modern look. A vibrant orange (#e44d26) is used for price tags and buttons to draw attention and evoke urgency, boosting conversions. Product cards are uniformly sized (250px minimum width) in a responsive grid layout for clarity and accessibility across devices. Hover effects add interactivity, encouraging engagement. These choices maximize sales, reduce bounce rates, and increase time on site by creating an inviting, easy-to-navigate display. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears statically at the top of the homepage with a 20px margin, ensuring immediate visibility upon landing. It can also be triggered dynamically on category pages or after a user scrolls past the hero section, reinforcing product exposure to maximize page views and conversions. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can hover over product cards for a subtle lift effect, enhancing engagement. Clicking the "Add to Cart" button adds items to their cart, with a potential confirmation animation. Clicking product images or names could redirect to detailed product pages, increasing page views and time on site while reducing cart abandonment through seamless navigation. -->
