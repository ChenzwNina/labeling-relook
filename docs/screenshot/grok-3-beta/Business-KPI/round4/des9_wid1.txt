    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean white background with subtle shadows for elevation, creating a professional look. It uses a blue color scheme (#007bff) for prices and CTAs to draw attention and evoke trust. The layout is split into two equal sections for shipping and add-ons, with hover effects and a selected state for interactivity. Cards are compact with readable 14px text and bold 18px titles for hierarchy. This design maximizes conversions by being visually clear, urgent, and actionable, encouraging users to upgrade shipping or add extras. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: This widget appears during the checkout process, specifically after users add items to their cart and proceed to the shipping or payment page. It can also reappear if users revisit the cart to ensure they donâ€™t miss upsell opportunities. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can click on shipping options to select their preferred method, with visual feedback (border highlight) for the chosen option. They can click 'Add' buttons for optional add-ons, potentially triggering a confirmation or cart update. Hover effects on cards and buttons enhance engagement, guiding users to make quick decisions. -->
