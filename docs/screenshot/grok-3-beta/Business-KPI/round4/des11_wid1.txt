<!-- Question 4.1: The widget is a fixed bar at the top of the viewport with a 20px margin, ensuring visibility. It uses a clean white background with a subtle shadow for prominence. The text is dark gray for readability, and the button is a striking red (#ff5252) to draw attention and encourage action. The layout is flexible, aligning elements side-by-side on desktop and stacking them on mobile for usability. These choices prioritize clarity and urgency, nudging users to engage while maintaining a professional look aligned with e-commerce aesthetics to reduce bounce rates and cart abandonment. -->
<!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears when a user is logged into their account and navigates to the membership or account settings page, or if they have an active subscription flagged for potential cancellation (e.g., after a support query or payment issue). Itâ€™s triggered by user context to ensure relevance and maximize engagement. -->
<!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact by clicking the "Cancel Membership" button, which redirects to a cancellation form or survey to gather feedback, reducing abandonment. Hovering over the button provides visual feedback with a color change, enhancing usability. On mobile, the full-width button ensures easy tapping. -->
