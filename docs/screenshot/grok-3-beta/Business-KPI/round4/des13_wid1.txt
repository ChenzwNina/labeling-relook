    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page with a 20px margin. The color scheme uses a vibrant coral (#ff6f61) for the sign-in button to draw attention and encourage clicks, paired with neutral grays for text and borders for readability. Input fields are spacious with 12px padding, and the layout is centered and compact (350px width) for focus. These choices maximize conversion by creating a welcoming, professional look that builds trust and minimizes friction. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears when a user navigates to the sign-in page of the e-commerce website or clicks on a "Sign In" link from the header navigation. It may also trigger as a modal or redirect if a user attempts to access account-specific features like checkout or order history without being logged in, reducing cart abandonment. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact by entering their email and password in the input fields, clicking the "Sign In" button to log in, selecting "Forgot Password?" to reset credentials, or clicking "Create an Account" to register. Hover effects on buttons and links provide visual feedback, enhancing usability and engagement. -->
