    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a vibrant gradient background (coral to peach) to grab attention and evoke excitement, aligning with e-commerce branding. Itâ€™s centered at the top with a 20px margin, ensuring visibility without obstructing content. The layout is compact (max-width: 600px) with a bold headline (24px), descriptive text (16px), and a simple form for easy interaction. A subtle shadow and animation add a modern feel, enhancing engagement. These choices prioritize visibility, urgency, and ease of use to drive conversions and reduce bounce rates. -->
