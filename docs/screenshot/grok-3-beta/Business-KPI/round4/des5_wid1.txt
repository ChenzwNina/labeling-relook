    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel has a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a professional look. It uses a coral accent color (#ff6f61) for checkboxes and the 'Apply Filters' button to draw attention and encourage action. The layout is responsive, with flexbox ensuring sections adapt to screen size, and text is legible with 14-18px font sizes. These choices enhance usability, reduce bounce rates, and maximize conversion by making filtering intuitive and visually appealing. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The filter panel appears on product listing pages by default, positioned at the top for immediate visibility. It is triggered when a user navigates to a category or search results page, ensuring they can refine their search from the start to find relevant products quickly. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by selecting multiple checkboxes across categories, price ranges, and brands to narrow down product results. Hover effects on labels provide visual feedback, and clicking the 'Apply Filters' button updates the product list. This interactivity reduces cart abandonment by helping users find desired items efficiently. -->
