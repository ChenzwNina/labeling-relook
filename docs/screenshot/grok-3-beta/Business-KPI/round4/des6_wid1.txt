<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white product card on a light gray background for contrast. The card is 300px wide with rounded corners and a subtle shadow for a premium feel. The image takes up significant space (200px height) to attract attention, while bold red (#e44d26) for price and button emphasizes urgency and action. Hover effects on the card and button enhance interactivity. These choices maximize sales and conversion by focusing on visuals and clear CTAs, reducing bounce rates with an engaging layout. -->
<!-- Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as a featured item on the homepage. Itâ€™s triggered by user navigation to specific categories or search results, ensuring relevance and encouraging exploration to boost time on site and page views. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can hover over the card for a subtle lift effect, click the image or title to view detailed product pages (increasing page views), and click "Add to Cart" to initiate purchase (reducing cart abandonment). They can also read the description and rating for trust, enhancing conversion rates and time on site. -->
