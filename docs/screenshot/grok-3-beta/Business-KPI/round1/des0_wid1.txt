<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for depth, positioned 20px from the top. It uses a grid layout for responsiveness, with product cards of equal size (250px minimum width). Colors include a bold orange (#e44d26) for price and CTA buttons to draw attention, and gold (#f1c40f) for ratings to signify quality. Hover effects on cards (lift and shadow) enhance interactivity. These choices maximize conversions by focusing on clarity, urgency, and trust through ratings and prominent CTAs, encouraging purchases and longer site engagement. -->

    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically at the top of the homepage or category pages, as it showcases featured products to all visitors. It can also trigger on scroll if placed lower on the page, or dynamically update based on user browsing history or trending items, increasing relevance and engagement. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can hover over product cards for visual feedback (lift effect), click "Add to Cart" to purchase, and potentially click product images or names for detailed views. These interactions drive sales, reduce bounce rates by encouraging exploration, and minimize cart abandonment with clear, immediate action options. -->
