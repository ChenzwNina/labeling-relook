<!-- Question 1: The shopping cart widget features a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadows, and rounded corners for a professional look. The color scheme uses a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for buttons and highlights to create urgency and draw attention, encouraging purchases. The layout is compact (350px wide) to avoid cluttering the screen, positioned at the top-right for easy access. Text and images are balanced with readable font sizes (0.9rem-1.5rem) to ensure clarity. These choices maximize conversion rates by making the cart visually appealing and accessible, reducing cart abandonment. -->

    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user clicks the cart toggle icon (a shopping cart symbol) located at the top-right of the viewport. It can also be triggered programmatically when items are added to the cart (though not implemented in this static example), ensuring users are reminded of their selections to drive sales. -->

    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the toggle icon to open/close the cart, viewing item details (image, name, quantity, price), and clicking the "Proceed to Checkout" button to finalize their purchase. Hover effects on buttons enhance engagement, while the design encourages further browsing or checkout, reducing bounce rates and increasing order size. -->
