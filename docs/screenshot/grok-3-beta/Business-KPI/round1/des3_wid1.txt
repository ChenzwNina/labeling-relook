    <!-- Question 4.1: The search panel spans the full width with a white background and subtle shadow for depth, positioned 20px from the top. The search bar is centrally placed, wide (600px max), with a rounded border and coral (#ff6f61) accents for CTA visibility. The input field is spacious for easy typing, and the search button is bold and hover-responsive. Quick links on the right are compact, dark-texted for readability, and turn coral on hover. These choices enhance usability, brand recognition, and encourage clicks, maximizing conversion and sales. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The search panel appears persistently at the top of every page on the e-commerce site. It is a fixed element, ensuring users can access it anytime without scrolling, reducing bounce rates and increasing time on site by facilitating immediate product searches. -->
