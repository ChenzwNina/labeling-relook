<!-- Question 1: The widget is a centered, fixed-position modal with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a modern, approachable look. It uses a red header (#d32f2f) to grab attention and evoke urgency, while green (#4caf50) and red buttons contrast for clear action choices. The layout is clean, with a max-width of 600px for readability, and elements like the special offer banner in yellow (#fff3cd) encourage retention. These choices aim to reduce cart abandonment and increase conversion by making the interface emotionally engaging and easy to navigate. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to the membership cancellation page or clicks a "Cancel Membership" link in their account settings. It can also be triggered by backend logic detecting prolonged inactivity or dissatisfaction signals, prompting a retention check. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by selecting a cancellation reason from a dropdown, typing feedback in a textarea, and choosing between "Keep Membership" or "Confirm Cancellation" buttons. Hover effects on buttons provide feedback, and clicking "Keep Membership" may redirect to a special offer page, while confirming cancellation submits the form and processes the request. -->
