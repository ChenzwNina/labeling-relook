    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for a professional look. The color scheme uses coral (#ff6f61) for buttons and links to create a vibrant, inviting feel that encourages action. The layout is centered, with a 400px-wide form for focus and clarity. Text and input fields are sized for readability (14-24px), and spacing ensures a non-cluttered appearance. These choices maximize conversion by creating trust, urgency, and ease of use. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: This widget appears on the account creation page or as a prompt when a user attempts to checkout without an account. It can also be triggered via a promotional banner or pop-up encouraging registration for exclusive benefits, reducing bounce rates and increasing engagement. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact by entering their name, email, and password into the form fields, submitting the form via the "Create Account" button, or clicking the login link if they already have an account. Hover effects on buttons and links provide visual feedback, enhancing usability and guiding users to complete registration or navigate elsewhere. -->
