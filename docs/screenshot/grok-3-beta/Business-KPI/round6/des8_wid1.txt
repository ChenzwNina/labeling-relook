    <!-- Question 4.1: The shopping cart widget is a fixed-position element at the top-right corner with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a modern look. It uses a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for buttons and price highlights to draw attention and encourage action. The layout is compact (350px wide) with clear hierarchy—header, item list with images (50x50px), and a prominent checkout button—to ensure ease of use. These choices maximize conversion (Rule 3.2) and reduce cart abandonment (Rule 3.8) by making the cart visually appealing and accessible. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears when a user clicks the cart toggle button (a shopping cart icon) positioned at the top-right corner. It can also be triggered programmatically after adding an item to the cart (though not implemented in this code) to reinforce user actions and increase engagement (Rule 3.5). -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact with the widget by clicking the toggle button to open/close it, viewing cart contents with product images and prices, and clicking the "Proceed to Checkout" button to complete their purchase. These interactions are designed to streamline the buying process, boost order size (Rule 3.3), and minimize bounce rates (Rule 3.9). -->
