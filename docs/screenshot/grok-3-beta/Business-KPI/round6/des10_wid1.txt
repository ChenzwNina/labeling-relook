    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a vibrant gradient background (coral to peach) to grab attention and evoke excitement, aligning with e-commerce energy. The layout is centered with a bold headline (28px) and descriptive text (16px) for clarity. Input fields and the CTA button are prominently sized with rounded corners for a modern look, and a hover effect on the button (color swap) encourages clicks. The design maximizes visibility with a full-width banner and subtle shadows for depth. These choices aim to boost conversions (Rule 3.2) and reduce bounce rates (Rule 3.9) by being visually engaging. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears at the top of the page on load for all users, ensuring immediate visibility. It can also reappear via a scroll-triggered event or after a user interacts with specific site elements (e.g., viewing products), targeting potential members at key moments to maximize sign-ups (Rule 3.1). -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can enter their name and email in the input fields, click the 'Join Now' button to submit, and hover over the button for visual feedback. They can also read the benefits list to understand membership value, encouraging prolonged engagement (Rule 3.5) and reducing cart abandonment (Rule 3.8) through perceived value. -->
