    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for elevation, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page. Green (#4CAF50) is used for progress indicators to signify positive status, while coral (#ff6f61) for the CTA button grabs attention and encourages clicks. The layout is centered with a responsive design, using a progress bar and icons for visual tracking. Text is clear with a hierarchy (24px header, 16px details), enhancing readability. These choices build trust, encourage interaction, and reduce bounce rates by providing clear, engaging information. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears automatically when a user logs into their account and navigates to the "My Orders" section or clicks on a specific order confirmation email link. It can also be triggered post-purchase via a dashboard update or notification. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can view their order status through the progress bar and icons, hover over steps for additional tooltips (if enhanced with JS), and click the "View Order Details" button to access a detailed order page with tracking links, item lists, and support options, maximizing engagement and time on site. -->
