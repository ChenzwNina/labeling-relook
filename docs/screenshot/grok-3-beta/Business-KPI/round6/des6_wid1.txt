Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white product card on a light gray background for contrast. The card is 300px wide, centered with a subtle shadow and hover effect (lift on hover) to draw attention. The image (200px height) is prominent to showcase the product, followed by a bold title (1.5em), vibrant price in orange (#e44d26) for urgency, a gold rating for trust, and a concise description. The "Add to Cart" button is full-width, orange, and changes shade on hover for interactivity. These choices prioritize visual appeal, clarity, and call-to-action to drive sales and reduce bounce rate.

Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as a featured item on the homepage of the e-commerce site. It can also be triggered in search results or category pages when a user browses specific product types.

Question 3: Users can hover over the card for a subtle lift effect, enhancing engagement. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to instantly add the item to their shopping cart. Additionally, users may click the image or title to view a detailed product page for more information.
