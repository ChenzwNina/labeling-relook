    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadow for depth, and a coral (#ff6f61) call-to-action button to draw attention. The layout is centered, with a max-width of 500px for readability, and input fields are spacious with rounded corners for a friendly feel. Text uses a grayscale palette for hierarchy—dark for headings, lighter for descriptions. These choices enhance trust (clean design), urgency (bold CTA), and usability (clear layout), driving conversions and sales. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: This widget appears on the homepage for new visitors or during checkout if the user isn’t logged in. It can also trigger as a pop-up after a user browses for a set time (e.g., 30 seconds) or adds items to the cart without signing in, encouraging account creation to reduce cart abandonment. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can enter their name, email, and password in the form fields, submit the form via the “Create Account” button, and click the “Log in here” link if they’re existing users. Hover effects on the button and link provide visual feedback, while form validation ensures correct input, enhancing user engagement and retention. -->
