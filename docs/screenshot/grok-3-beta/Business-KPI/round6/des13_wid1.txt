Question 1: The widget features a clean, centered sign-in box with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a modern look. The color scheme uses a vibrant coral (#ff6f61) for the sign-in button to draw attention and encourage clicks, paired with neutral grays and blues for trust and professionalism. The layout is compact (350px width) to focus user attention, with clear input fields and legible typography (16px for inputs, 24px for heading). These choices enhance usability, reduce bounce rates, and maximize conversions by creating a welcoming, professional interface.

Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to the sign-in page of the e-commerce website or clicks on a "Sign In" link in the header/navigation bar. It may also trigger as a pop-up if a user attempts to access account-specific features (e.g., checkout or wishlist) without being logged in, encouraging engagement.

Question 3: Users can enter their email and password, click the "Sign In" button to log in, click "Forgot Password?" to reset credentials, or select "Create an Account" to register. Hover effects on buttons and links provide visual feedback, enhancing interactivity and guiding users through the process to reduce abandonment.
