    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. Colors include a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention and encourage purchases, paired with neutral tones (#333) for text and backgrounds. Product cards are uniformly sized in a responsive grid layout, ensuring clarity across devices. Images are large (200px height) to showcase products, and hover effects add interactivity. These choices maximize visual appeal, conversion rates, and sales by focusing on product visibility and easy navigation. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically at the top of the homepage with a 20px margin, visible upon page load. It serves as a primary engagement tool, triggered by user visits to ensure immediate exposure to high-value or trending items. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can hover over product cards for visual feedback (lift effect), click "Add to Cart" buttons to initiate purchases, and click "View More Products" to explore additional items. These interactions reduce cart abandonment and bounce rates by simplifying buying actions and encouraging deeper site exploration. -->
