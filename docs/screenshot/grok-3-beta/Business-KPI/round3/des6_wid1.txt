Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white product card on a light gray background for contrast. The card (300px wide) has rounded corners, a subtle shadow for depth, and a hover effect for interactivity. The image (200px height) is prominent to attract attention, while the title (1.5em) and price (bold, red) are eye-catching to drive purchases. The "Add to Cart" button is vibrant red (#e44d26) for urgency and spans the card width for easy clicking. These choices prioritize clarity, visual appeal, and conversion by emphasizing key actions.

Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as a featured item on the homepage. It can also trigger on search result pages or related product sections, ensuring visibility during browsing or after specific user queries for headphones or electronics.

Question 3: Users can hover over the card for a subtle lift effect, enhancing engagement. They can click the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase, view the product image for details, and read the description for information. These interactions encourage exploration, reduce cart abandonment, and boost conversion by simplifying the buying process.
