    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background, subtle shadows, and rounded corners for a professional look. Blue accents (#007bff) are used for prices and the CTA button to draw attention and evoke trust. Cards for shipping and add-ons are evenly spaced, with hover and selected states to enhance interactivity. Text is hierarchically styled for readability. These choices maximize conversion (Rule 3.2) and reduce cart abandonment (Rule 3.8) by making options clear and engaging. -->
    <!-- Question 2: This widget appears during the checkout process, typically after the user reviews their cart and before payment. It triggers when the user navigates to the shipping and add-ons selection page, ensuring they consider upgrades that boost order value (Rule 3.3). -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by clicking shipping options to select their preferred method, with visual feedback (blue border) confirming choices. They can toggle add-ons by clicking cards to include/exclude them. Hover effects provide cues, and the 'Proceed to Checkout' button advances the process. These interactions minimize bounce rate (Rule 3.9) and encourage completion. -->
