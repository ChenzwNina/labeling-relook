    <!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for depth, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page. Green (#2ecc71) highlights active progress steps, evoking trust and positivity, while a red CTA button (#e74c3c) grabs attention to drive clicks. The layout is centered with a max-width of 800px for readability, and progress steps are evenly spaced for clarity. Font sizes (24px header, 16px details) ensure hierarchy and accessibility. These choices boost engagement, reduce confusion, and encourage interaction to maximize conversions and time on site. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically when a user logs into their account and navigates to the "My Orders" section or clicks a tracking link from an email confirmation. It can also display on the homepage if an order is in progress, ensuring visibility and relevance. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can view order details (ID, date, status) and track progress via the visual timeline. Clicking the "View Order Details" button navigates to a detailed order page for deeper engagement. Hover effects on the CTA button provide feedback, enhancing usability and encouraging further exploration. -->
