<!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, white background with a subtle shadow for depth, ensuring it stands out at the top of the page. The logo is bold and orange (#e44d26) to grab attention, while category links are in a neutral gray (#333) for readability, turning orange on hover for interactivity. The layout is horizontal for desktop, stacking vertically on mobile for usability. A bright orange promo banner adds urgency to drive sales. These choices prioritize clarity, brand recognition, and conversion-focused design. -->
