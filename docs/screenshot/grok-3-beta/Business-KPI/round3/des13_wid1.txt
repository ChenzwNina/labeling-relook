<!-- Question 4.1: The sign-in widget features a clean, minimalistic design with a white background and subtle shadow for a professional look. The color scheme uses a vibrant coral (#ff6f61) for the button and links to evoke energy and encourage action, paired with neutral grays for text and borders for readability. The layout is centered, with a fixed width of 350px for the form, ensuring focus and simplicity. Input fields are spacious with rounded corners for ease of use. These choices prioritize user trust, clarity, and conversion by creating a welcoming, distraction-free interface. -->
<!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears when a user clicks on a "Sign In" link in the website header or attempts to access account-specific features like order history or checkout without being logged in.

<!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact by entering their email and password in the input fields, clicking the "Sign In" button to log in, accessing "Forgot Password?" for recovery, or selecting "Create Account" to register.
