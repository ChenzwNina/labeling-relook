    <!-- Question 4.1: The filter panel is a fixed, left-aligned sidebar with a clean white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a modern look. It uses a coral (#ff6f61) CTA button to draw attention and encourage action, aligning with conversion goals. Text is in shades of gray for readability, and elements are compact (250px width) to avoid clutter while ensuring usability. The layout is vertical with clear sections for category, price, and brand filters, promoting ease of use to reduce bounce rates and increase time on site. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears automatically on product listing pages, positioned at the top-left with a 20px margin from the viewport top. It remains visible as users scroll, ensuring constant access to filtering options without disrupting the shopping experience, which helps minimize cart abandonment. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact by selecting categories from a dropdown, adjusting a price range slider, toggling brand checkboxes, clicking the "Apply Filters" button to update product results, and using "Clear All Filters" to reset selections. These interactions are intuitive, encouraging exploration, increasing page views, and supporting higher order sizes through tailored product discovery. -->
