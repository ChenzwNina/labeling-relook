Question 1: The widget features a vibrant gradient background (orange to peach) to grab attention and convey energy, encouraging signups. The container spans the full width with a centered content area of 800px for readability. The headline is large (28px) and uppercase for impact, while the description text (16px) is clear and persuasive. Input fields and the button are prominently sized with subtle shadows for depth, and the button has a hover effect (scale and color change) to drive clicks. These choices align with maximizing conversions (3.2) and reducing bounce rates (3.9) by creating an engaging, urgent call-to-action.

Question 2: The widget appears at the top of the viewport on every page load for non-members, ensuring maximum visibility. It triggers specifically for users who haven’t signed up yet, detected via cookies or login status, to target potential members and increase signups (3.1, 3.7).

Question 3: Users can interact by entering their email in the input field and clicking “Join Now” to submit the form. Hover effects on the button provide visual feedback. Post-submission, a confirmation message or redirect to a benefits page could appear (not coded here), enhancing engagement and time on site (3.5, 3.6).
