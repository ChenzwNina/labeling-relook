<!-- Question 4.1: The sign-in widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation, positioned at the top with a 20px margin. It uses a coral color (#ff6f61) for buttons and links to evoke energy and encourage action, enhancing conversion rates. The layout is centered, compact (400px width), with bold typography (24px title) and adequately spaced inputs (12px padding) for clarity and ease of use. These choices prioritize user trust and accessibility, minimizing bounce rates and maximizing time on site by offering a seamless login experience. -->
<!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears prominently at the top of the page on load for non-logged-in users, ensuring immediate visibility. It may also trigger as a modal or sticky bar when users attempt to access account-specific features like order history or checkout, reducing cart abandonment by prompting authentication at critical moments. -->
<!-- Question 4.3: Users can interact by entering their email and password in the input fields, clicking the 'Sign In' button to log in, accessing 'Forgot Password?' for recovery, or 'Create an Account' to register. Hover effects on buttons and links provide visual feedback, enhancing engagement and guiding users through the process effortlessly. -->
