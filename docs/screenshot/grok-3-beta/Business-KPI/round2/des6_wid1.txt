Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for the product card, a striking red (#e44d26) for price and CTA button to grab attention, and subtle gray tones for text to ensure readability. The card is 300px wide with a 200px image height for optimal visibility, rounded corners for a polished look, and a hover effect for interactivity. These choices maximize sales and conversion by focusing on visual appeal, urgency (discount badge), and a clear "Add to Cart" button.

Question 2: This widget appears on product listing pages or as part of a featured product section on the homepage. It can also be triggered in search results or category pages when a user browses specific items, ensuring visibility during key decision-making moments.

Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over the product card for a subtle lift effect, clicking the "Add to Cart" button to initiate a purchase, and potentially clicking the image or title to view detailed product pages. These interactions encourage deeper engagement, reduce bounce rate, and drive conversions by simplifying the buying process.
