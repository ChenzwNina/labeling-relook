    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a vibrant gradient background (coral to peach) to grab attention, with white text for contrast. It’s wide (max-width 1200px) and centered with a 20px top margin for prominence. The layout is clean, with a bold headline (2.2em), descriptive text (1.1em), and a compact form (max-width 400px) for easy interaction. The button is white with coral text, creating a strong CTA, and hover effects add interactivity. Benefits are listed in subtle pills for quick readability. These choices prioritize visibility, urgency, and trust to drive conversions. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears at the top of the homepage or key landing pages, triggered on page load for new or non-logged-in users. It may also reappear after a user browses for a set time (e.g., 30 seconds) or adds items to the cart without signing up, encouraging membership to reduce cart abandonment. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can enter their name and email in the form fields, submit the form via the “Join Now” button (with hover and click feedback), and view membership benefits. Post-submission, a confirmation message or redirect to a welcome page may appear. Users can also ignore the widget, though its prominent placement encourages interaction. -->
