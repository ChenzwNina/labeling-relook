    <!-- Question 1: The search panel is designed with a clean, modern look using a white background (#ffffff) for clarity and a subtle shadow for depth. The coral color (#ff6f61) for the search button and links adds vibrancy, encouraging clicks (maximizing conversion). The input field is wide (60% of viewport, max 800px) for usability, with a 16px font for readability. The layout is centered and fixed at the top (20px margin) for constant accessibility, boosting page views and time on site. Suggestions are included to guide users to popular categories, reducing bounce rate. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The search panel is always visible at the top of the page upon loading, ensuring immediate access without any specific trigger. This persistent placement minimizes shopping cart abandonment by facilitating quick product searches at any point during navigation. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by typing queries into the search input field, clicking the search button to initiate a search, and clicking on suggested category links to explore popular items. The input field highlights on focus, and the button and links change color on hover for feedback, enhancing user engagement and encouraging further interaction to maximize order size and click-through rates. -->
