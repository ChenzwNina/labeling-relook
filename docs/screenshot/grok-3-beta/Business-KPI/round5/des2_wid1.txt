<!-- Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for elevation. The logo uses a vibrant coral (#ff6347) to draw attention, while navigation links are in dark gray (#333) for readability, turning coral on hover for interactivity. The layout is horizontal, centered with a max-width of 1200px for responsiveness, and includes a promo message on the right to encourage purchases. These choices enhance visibility, brand recognition, and user engagement, aligning with goals to maximize sales, conversion rates, and time on site. -->
<!-- Question 2: The widget appears persistently at the top of the viewport on every page of the e-commerce site. Its fixed position ensures constant accessibility to product categories, reducing navigation friction and encouraging exploration without needing specific user triggers. -->
<!-- Question 3: Users can interact with the widget by hovering over category links for visual feedback (color change and underline), clicking links to navigate to specific category pages, clicking the logo to return to the homepage, and noticing the promo message which may prompt larger orders. These interactions minimize bounce rates and cart abandonment by simplifying navigation and incentivizing purchases. -->
