    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards, a vibrant orange (#e44d26) for prices and buttons to draw attention, and a subtle gray (#333) for text for readability. The grid layout adapts to screen size with cards at a minimum of 250px wide, ensuring accessibility. Images are large (200px height) to showcase products, and hover effects (lift and shadow) encourage interaction. These choices maximize visual appeal, conversion rates, and sales by focusing on product visibility and easy navigation. -->
    <!-- Question 4.2: The widget appears automatically at the top of the homepage or category pages with a 20px margin from the top, ensuring immediate visibility. It may also load dynamically based on user search or filter inputs to display relevant products, reducing bounce rates and increasing time on site. -->
    <!-- Question 4.3: Users can hover over product cards for a visual feedback effect, click on cards to view detailed product pages, and click "Add to Cart" buttons to initiate purchases. These interactions are designed to minimize cart abandonment and maximize order size by simplifying the buying process. -->
