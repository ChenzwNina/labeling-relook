    <!-- Question 4.1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. The color scheme uses a vibrant coral (#ff6f61) for the CTA button and accents to draw attention and evoke energy, paired with neutral grays for text to ensure readability. The layout is centered with a max-width of 500px for focus, and form fields are spacious with 12px padding for ease of use. These choices enhance trust, usability, and conversion by creating a professional, inviting interface. -->
