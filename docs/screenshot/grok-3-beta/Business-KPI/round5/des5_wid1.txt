    <!-- Question 1: The filter panel is a fixed, vertical sidebar on the left, 250px wide, with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a coral accent color (#ff6f61) for checkboxes and the 'Apply Filters' button to draw attention and encourage action. Text is in grayscale for hierarchyâ€”dark for headings, lighter for options. The layout is clean with categorized sections for easy navigation. These choices maximize usability, conversion rates, and time on site by simplifying product discovery. -->
    <!-- Question 2: The widget appears automatically on product listing pages or category pages where filtering is relevant. It remains visible as users scroll, ensuring constant access to refine searches without disrupting the shopping flow, reducing bounce rates and cart abandonment. -->
    <!-- Question 3: Users can interact by checking/unchecking filter options across categories like price, brand, and type to narrow down products. Clicking 'Apply Filters' updates the product grid dynamically, while 'Clear All' resets selections. Hover effects on buttons and links provide feedback, enhancing engagement and encouraging exploration, which boosts page views and order size. -->
