Question 1:
The banner is a fixed component at the top of the page with a 20-pixel margin. It has a warm orange gradient background, large white text for urgency, rounded corners, and a drop shadow for modern aesthetics. The left features a 54x54px deal image with a soft border, followed by the promo text (bold title and smaller description). To the right, there’s a bold orange-and-white “Shop Deals” button and an “×” close button in the top-right. On small screens, spacing shrinks for mobile comfort. These choices ensure visual prominence, brand vibrancy, and high click-through.

Question 2:
The banner appears automatically when a user visits the homepage or relevant shopping pages during an active deals campaign (e.g., flash sale or holiday). It is present from the first page load to capture attention immediately.

Question 3:
Users can: (a) Click “Shop Deals” to view all active promotions (redirects to /deals), (b) close the banner with the “×” button (hides banner), and (c) click anywhere on the button (not elsewhere) for interaction. The component is fully accessible, and adapts layout responsively.
