Question 1: 
    The widget is a top-centered, card-like sign-in panel with a white background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow for elevation. It's 350px wide (responsive to 90vw), with a blue gradient sign-in button as the primary CTA. Headings are bold and dark, inputs are roomy with soft borders, and links and social buttons have brand-accentuated styles. Layout is vertical, elements are generously padded and spaced for clarity and real-world e-commerce feel.

    Question 2: 
    The widget appears when a user indicates a desire to sign in â€“ for example, by clicking "Sign In" in a header or when an action requires authentication (such as proceeding to checkout or viewing account details).

    Question 3: 
    Users can: enter email/password, toggle "Remember me", use "Forgot password?", submit form, sign in via Google/Facebook, and navigate to registration. All input fields have focus and error capabilities, and links/buttons give standard hover/focus visual feedback.
