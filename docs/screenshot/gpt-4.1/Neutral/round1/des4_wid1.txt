Question 1: The widget appears as a horizontally-aligned product list box, centered at the top of the page, with a 20px top margin. The container has a white, rounded background and a subtle drop-shadow for elevation. Each product card is lightly bordered with rounded corners, shadow, and grows slightly on hover. Product images are 132x132px, product names are bold, and primary CTA buttons are a purple-blue gradient. The design is modern, inviting, and typical of current e-commerce layouts for clarity and trust.

  Question 2: The product list widget appears immediately when the page loads, as it's designed to showcase featured or relevant products to the user near the top of the e-commerce site.

  Question 3: User interactions include: hovering on a product card for a shadow effect, clicking on "Add to Cart" buttons (could be enhanced to trigger actual add-to-cart logic), or viewing details (e.g. image alt text). The design can also support click events for navigating to product detail pages if desired.
