Question 1: 
The widget is a centered, white rounded rectangle with subtle drop-shadow, providing a floating effect and clear separation from the background. The logo (circular placeholder) is on the left, next to a category dropdown and search input field, with a bold blue 'Search' button at the right. The button has a search icon for clarity. The UI uses neutral greys with a blue accent (#2d76ee), and the sizing is spacious: the overall height about 60px, with well-padded inputs, for good usability and modern aesthetics—matching real e-commerce interfaces.

Question 2:
The widget appears by default at the top of the webpage, always visible to encourage product discovery, following common e-commerce best practices. It is not triggered by interaction; it is present as soon as users land on the page.

Question 3:
Users can interact by: 
- Clicking the logo (could be linked to home in full implementation).
- Selecting a product category via the dropdown to filter their search.
- Typing queries in the search input.
- Submitting the search with the button or pressing Enter.
- Field highlights on focus for feedback.
- On narrower screens, the layout adapts for mobile.
