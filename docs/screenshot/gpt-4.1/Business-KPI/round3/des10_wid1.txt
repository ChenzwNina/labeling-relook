4.1 Question 1: The widget features a modern, clean look with a white card layout and rounded corners. The brand logo sits left-aligned within the header, followed by a bold title and a concise subtitle. Main colors include white (#fff) for the card, blue gradients for calls-to-action (#3880ff), and touches of green and gold for accents. The membership benefits list uses visible, well-spaced bullet points. Form inputs are generously spaced, and the main button uses a strong gradient to encourage action. Below, a discount offer is prominent, followed by an ad block styled in soft yellow tones to attract attention without overwhelming. These choices maximize legibility, visual hierarchy, incentive visibility, and drive engagement.

4.2 Question 2: The widget appears at the very top of the viewport when users land on the homepage or a relevant landing page. It can also be triggered on exit intent, or when users show high engagement, either as a static card or via a modal.

4.3 Question 3: Users can review membership benefits, fill out and submit the sign-up form, agree to terms, and click the CTA to join. They can also click on bolded discount offers and explore advertised deals (boosting ad CTR). Hover states and input validation provide responsive feedback, and links direct to terms or special sales. The interactive design encourages both signup and browsing/site exploration.
