4.1. The filter panel is a fixed, wide widget at the top of the viewport with a soft white background, subtle box-shadow, and rounded corners for a premium feel. Icons and section labels use a blue, gray, and orange palette to signal interactivity and urgency (e.g., "Reset All" in orange, "Apply Filters" in blue). Typography is modern, clean, and bold for titles; element spacing and field sizes optimize readability and touch interaction. This design uses strong affordances, visual hierarchy, and brand-aligned colors to improve discoverability and conversion.
