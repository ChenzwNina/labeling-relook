Question 4.1: The widget features a horizontal list of five product cards at the top of the page, on a clean white background with soft shadows and rounded corners for modern appeal. Each product card is 220px wide, with a high-quality image, product name, star rating, concise description, current price, old price (strikethrough), promotion badge, and prominent “Add to Cart” and wishlist buttons. Bright call-to-action colors (blues and greens), accent highlights (yellow/orange for sales) maximize visibility and click-throughs, while a responsive layout ensures usability across devices. These choices direct user attention and encourage browsing, cart additions, and repeat visits.

Question 4.2: The widget appears as a prominent feature on the e-commerce homepage or category pages, loaded automatically at the top of the viewport, 20px beneath the top edge. It may also serve as part of an upsell module after cart addition or in special promotional sections. No user trigger is needed; it always displays on load.

Question 4.3: Users can browse products by scrolling horizontally (or vertically on mobile), click "Add to Cart" to initiate purchases, use the heart/wishlist button to save items for later, or click elsewhere on cards (such as the image or product title) for detailed product pages. Promotional badges prompt further engagement. All elements are clickable and touch-friendly, maximizing interactions and conversions while keeping cart abandonment low and session durations high.
