4.1 Question 1: The widget features white background on a card with rounded corners and subtle shadows. Vibrant blues are used for primary actions, gold accents for badges, and muted gray text for secondary info. Main options (shipping methods) are horizontally placed as selectable cards, each with time/cost details and badges (e.g., Best Value). Below, add-on products are shown as selectable cards with small images. Sticky summary at bottom reflects selections and total price, complemented with a blue call-to-action button. These choices direct attention, support rapid scanning, encourage upsells, and reduce cognitive friction, optimizing for conversions, upsell, and engagement (see design rules above).

4.2 Question 2: The widget appears at the top of the relevant checkout or cart page, or when the user is prompted to choose shipping and available order add-ons—right when they are most engaged in finalizing the purchase, maximizing relevancy and minimizing abandonment risk.

4.3 Question 3: Users can select one shipping method by clicking the corresponding card (mutual exclusive radio). Add-ons can be toggled on or off by clicking their cards (checkbox per add-on). Selected options update the summary and pricing instantly. Proceeding (button) takes them to the next checkout/payment step. Visual selections are clear via color; badges highlight popular/fastest. Widget stays above the fold, ensuring visibility for returning users and reducing abandonment.
