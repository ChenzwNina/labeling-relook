4.1: The widget uses a bright white background with soft shadows and rounded corners to stand out at the top of the page. A large "4.7" rating in gold is followed by bold stars and "2,413 ratings" for social proof. Below, distribution bars display the counts of each rating. Consistent warm tones (gold/orange) encourage positive associations, and ample whitespace makes the widget clean and inviting. CTA buttons are large and high-contrast: "Write a Review" in warm gold to drive engagement, and secondary options for browsing reviews and discovering top-rated items to maximize engagement, conversions, and AOV.

4.2: The widget appears at the top of the viewport with a 20-pixel margin from the top, visible as soon as the product details or relevant page loads, catching attention immediately. It remains static (not sticky unless further specified), ensuring users can't miss the ratings/social proof as a key purchase trigger.

4.3: Users can (a) see summary rating info, (b) visually scan detailed rating distribution, (c) click "Write a Review" to leave feedback (reducing future abandonment, boosting trust), (d) click "Read All Reviews" to browse social proof (increasing time on site/page views), and (e) click "See Top Rated Products" (potential cross-sell/up-sell, increasing AOV and repeat visits). These actions keep users engaged, moving them further into the purchase funnel.
