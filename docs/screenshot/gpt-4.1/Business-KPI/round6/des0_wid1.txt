4.1 The widget sits at the top of the viewport inside a card with soft white background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow. Headline and "See All Deals" link are spaced with justified flex, while featured product cards are in a horizontal scrollable flex row. Each card uses neutral backgrounds, a colored badge, image, product name, ratings, both old and new prices, and add-to-cart/wishlist actions. Visual hierarchy, bold deals, and calls to action help maximize conversion and engagement.

  4.2 The widget appears on page load at the top of the home page, category pages, and other high-traffic landing pages to showcase attractive or curated product deals and maximize user engagement.

  4.3 Users can (1) click "See All Deals" to view more featured products, (2) click "Add to Cart" on a product for instant cart addition, (3) click the heart/wishlist icon to save products, and (4) click anywhere on the product card or image to open the product detail page (could be linked in a real site). Product badges, hover states, visible discounts, and ratings offer cues that increase engagement and minimize cart abandonment.
