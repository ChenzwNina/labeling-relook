4.1 Question 1: The widget is a visually prominent banner, 1200px wide (full width on smaller screens), set 20px from the top. The color scheme uses a cheerful yellow gradient background (#fde68a to #fbbf24), denoting excitement and urgency. The left shows a rounded product/brand promo image (120px), followed by bold compelling headline text, dynamic deal buttons for major categories, and a bright red call-to-action button. A soft shadow and large close icon ensure it is noticeable but not intrusive. All text and buttons are generously sized for easy readability and tap targets.

  These choices maximize attention, stimulate urgent action, and drive users to high-revenue categories, supporting all nine goals: sale/conversion uplift, order size growth, advertising, and retention, while allowing unobtrusive dismissal to minimize irritation.

  4.2 Question 2: The banner appears shortly after page load (top of viewport) on all major e-commerce landing, category, and product pages, or whenever a new deal period starts. It’s triggered by current flash-sales or featured deal campaigns and remains until the user closes it (state can be stored via cookies/localStorage to avoid repeated display).

  4.3 Question 3: 
  Users can:
  - Click the close (×) button to dismiss the banner, eliminating distraction.
  - Click any deal pill button to instantly view promoted sale categories.
  - Click the prominent "Shop Flash Deals" button to enter the main deals event/landing page.
  - Click "Discover More Offers" to visit additional internal or external branded/advertiser offers.
  All elements have large, easy tap zones encouraging frequent interaction on both desktop and mobile.
