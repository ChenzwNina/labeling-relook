4.1: The widget is a fixed, horizontally scrollable navigation bar, placed 20px from the top. It features a white, rounded background with a subtle shadow for hierarchy. The logo/brand is leftmost, followed by clear, tactile category links (New Arrivals, Best Sellers, Women, etc.), each with gentle hover/active highlighting, a bright bundle offer button, and a clickable promotion/ad panel at the end. Accent colors include navy blue for stability/credibility, a bright orange gradient for CTAs (to draw the eye and boost conversion), and responsive tweaks for mobile. The layout maximizes visibility and discoverability of categories and calls to action.

4.2: The widget appears immediately at the top of all main site pages (especially landing/home/category/product pages) when a user loads or visits the site—no user interaction is required to trigger its appearance. This maximizes category and promotional discoverability right from entry, lowering bounce and abandonment rates.

4.3: Users can click category links to navigate between store sections. The "Shop 3+ & Save 10%" CTA button sends users to an upsell bundle deals page. Clicking the rightmost ad banner leads users to a promotional campaign. On desktop, the navigation is persistent; on smaller screens, it condenses, hiding secondary CTAs for a cleaner view. The currently viewed category is visually highlighted. All elements are keyboard-accessible and focusable for accessibility.
