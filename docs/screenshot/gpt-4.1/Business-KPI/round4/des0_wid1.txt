4.1: The widget appears as a horizontally scrollable carousel of product cards within a white-rounded, shadowed container, giving it clear separation atop a light gray page. Each product card uses vibrant badges, clean sans-serif fonts, and strong accent colors (blue, green, gold) for CTAs and discount indicators. Images are large for visual appeal. Each card clearly shows rating, price, old price (struck through for contrast), a benefit-driven promo label, and a visually prominent "Add to Cart" button. The header encourages ‘View All Deals’. The visual cue hierarchy, clear CTAs, highlight deals and urgency, all boost conversion, interaction, and time on site per e-commerce UX best practice.

  4.2: The widget is always visible—appearing at the top of the homepage, category, or landing page/layout where featured items should be prominently shown, ensuring maximum exposure to visitors and driving engagement and conversions as soon as they arrive.

  4.3: Users can scroll horizontally through featured products (especially important on mobile/tablet), click product images/titles to view details (if links are added), click the "Add to Cart" button to add items directly, and use the "View All Deals" link to discover more. Interactions include engaging with promos/badges, seeing instant price savings, and initiating purchase flows quickly, minimizing friction for key actions and maximizing engagement.
