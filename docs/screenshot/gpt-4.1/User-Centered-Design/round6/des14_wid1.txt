Question 1: 
    The widget is a horizontally-oriented panel, width 540px, floating at the top center with rounded corners and shadow. It uses a white background to ensure clarity. The main row displays the order image, info, and address. A progress bar with five trackable steps (Placed, Confirmed, Shipped, Out for Delivery, Delivered) uses color coding for completed (blue), current (amber), and upcoming (gray). Below, delivery details and a “Track Package” button are present. Colors are high-contrast blue/amber for feedback, muted gray for secondary info. All clickable/interactive elements show visual affordance and feedback by style changes on hover/focus/disable. Layout is spacious, with responsive resizing on mobile.

    Question 2: 
    This widget appears immediately after the user places an order or when they visit their order history/track order page, ensuring they always have quick access to the latest order’s tracking status.

    Question 3: 
    Users can: 
    - View order number, product image, address, order date.
    - Comprehend tracking progress visually and textually.
    - See delivery estimates and, unless delivered, click “Track Package” to go to the courier’s tracking portal.
    The “Track Package” button is disabled when the order is fully delivered, preventing unnecessary action. The UI visually highlights the current step, and each icon supports tooltips for accessibility.
