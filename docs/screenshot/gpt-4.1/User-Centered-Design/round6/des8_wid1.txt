4.1 Question 1: The shopping cart widget has a white background for contrast, subtle drop shadow for focus, and soft rounded corners for friendly UX. The title bar uses a pale grey background. Item cards show thumbnail images on the left, product name and detail, price, and actionable controls (qty +/- as buttons with visual states, remove as a link with red highlight). Font sizes and layout mimic real e-commerce clarity. Buttons are strong in color (blue/teal), disabled states are muted. Cart subtotal is emphasized, and the checkout button is blue and prominent. Responsive design ensures consistency and clean separation of elements. Choices ensure usability, clarity, and reassuring feedback.

  4.2 Question 2: This widget typically appears when a user clicks a "cart" icon in the site header or after adding an item to their cart. In this code snippet, it's set to display immediately for demo purposes, but in practice its visibility would be controlled (toggle show/hide).

  4.3 Question 3: Users can increase/decrease item quantities (minus disables at 1), remove items, close the cart, or proceed to checkout. All quantity changes update the subtotal and disable the checkout button if the cart is empty. There‘s clear, immediate feedback for all actions, constraints to prevent negative quantities or checkout with no items, and disabled states on relevant buttons. The “Remove” affordance is clear and visually distinct. The component also adapts for mobile screen widths.
