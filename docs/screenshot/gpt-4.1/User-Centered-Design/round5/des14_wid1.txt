Question 1: The order tracking widget uses a clean white card with soft shadows and rounded corners. The header includes a 60x60px product image, bold product name, and order number. Order status is emphasized using color (yellow for “Out for Delivery”). There’s a horizontal stepper with 4 steps (Ordered, Shipped, Out for Delivery, Delivered) using filled circles with icons and colored backgrounds: green for completed, yellow for current, gray for upcoming. A colored progress bar sits behind the circles for visual clarity. The order summary is shown in a blue-tinted box with clear labels and values, and a green refresh button with an icon provides manual status updates, with feedback displayed after clicking. The colors, sizes, and alignment are chosen for clarity, accessibility, and familiar e-commerce aesthetics.

  Question 2: The widget appears at the top of the viewport (20px margin) on order detail, order history, or tracking status pages, triggered by the user navigating to a page where a placed order’s tracking information should be visible (e.g., right after purchasing, from an “Orders” menu, or via a tracking link in email).

  Question 3: Users can visually review tracking progress, check order and delivery details, see the last scan update, and refresh the status via the “Refresh” button (which is disabled briefly during updates, preventing misuse). Feedback about refreshing is provided visually. Users see clear constraints—no step is interactive so accidental changes aren’t possible, and labels/affordances ensure the actions are clear. All core info is readable and feedback provided for the refresh action.
