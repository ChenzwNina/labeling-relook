Question 1: 
    The widget is a horizontally oriented white panel with rounded corners and a subtle shadow. At 780px wide (scaling on mobile), it's visually separated from the page with a 20px top margin. Prominent blue is used for primary actions/text and neutral grays for backgrounds and borders. Sections (“Category”, “Price Range”, “Brand”, “Customer Rating”) are evenly distributed. Inputs are clear with enough spacing, and “Apply Filters”/“Clear All” buttons are unmistakable in their action via color and hover effects. Consistency is maintained across all interactive elements, which are of moderate tap/click-friendly size for usability and accessibility.

    Design choices aim for clean visual hierarchy, immediate recognizability of each filter, clear actionable feedback (button states), and prominent affordances (distinct clickable areas and inputs).

    Question 2: 
    The filter panel is intended to be immediately visible at the top of the viewport whenever users land on a product listing page or perform searches/browse categories. Its fixed positioning makes it always accessible for quick filtering without requiring a click to reveal or scroll to find.

    Question 3: 
    Users can: 
    - Select a product category (radio buttons, one at a time).
    - Enter a price range, constrained so minimum ≤ maximum and both non-negative.
    - Select multiple brands (checkboxes).
    - Choose a customer rating (radio, only one at a time).
    - Click “Apply Filters” (only enabled if at least one filter is set) to trigger product filtering.
    - Click “Clear All” (enabled when filters are changed) to instantly reset all filters.
    - Users receive immediate feedback through enabled/disabled states and constraint validation on price input.
