Question 1: The widget features a white, rounded-corner card centered near the top of a pale background. At the top, it displays a company logo (“ShopEase”), bold heading, and tagline. Below, the form has clear labeled fields for email and password, a "Remember me" checkbox, and “Forgot password?” link. The main sign-in button is a prominent blue and only enabled when inputs validate. Social sign-in options use styled buttons with service logos. Beneath is a footer inviting new users to create an account. Visual feedback appears for invalid input, errors, and button states. The palette is modern (whites, blues, muted grays) with readable font sizing. Elements are spaced for clarity and touch accessibility—prioritizing clarity, feedback, and ease-of-use.

  Question 2: The widget appears when a user clicks "Sign In", "Account", or any sign-in related action on the e-commerce site, or when authentication is required for a protected page/action (e.g., checkout).

  Question 3: Users can enter email and password (with real-time validation and feedback), toggle “Remember me”, access password reset, and submit the form (with live feedback on submission state and errors). Buttons allow signing in with Google or Facebook. Users can also navigate to account creation. Constraints prevent submission with empty/invalid fields, and clear feedback/affordances inform all actions.
