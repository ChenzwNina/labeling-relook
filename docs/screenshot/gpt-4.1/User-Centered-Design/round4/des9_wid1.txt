Question 1: The component appears as a centered, card-like box with a white background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow, giving it prominence and approachability atop a light gray viewport. The shipping options are presented as radio buttons inside soft blue/gray pill backgrounds, each with descriptive text and cost—on selection, options are outlined for feedback. Add-ons are shown as checkboxes with clear labels, cost, and responsive highlight on selection. The "Continue to Payment" button is bold, blue, and full-width, ensuring visibility and clear affordance. These design choices ensure quick scanning, recognition, and task execution, reflecting patterns from major e-commerce UIs.

  Question 2: This widget appears on the shipping step in the checkout process—immediately when the user proceeds from their cart or address entry, so users can select shipping and any desired add-ons before payment.

  Question 3: Users can select one shipping method (radio, mandatory), and any mix of add-ons (checkboxes, optional). All choices provide immediate visual feedback (highlighted border/background). The proceed button is only temporarily disabled during feedback after clicking; otherwise, users can interact freely but cannot proceed without choosing a shipping method, which applies constraints. On submission, a status message appears, confirming the action. All choices are keyboard and screen-reader friendly, supporting efficient and satisfying interaction.
