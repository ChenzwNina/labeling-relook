Question 1: The shopping cart widget sits centered at the top of the viewport, 20px from the top, on a white, softly rounded, shadowed panel (420px wide or full width on mobile). Product images are left-aligned, with product names and price details beside them. Quantity adjustment buttons use muted colors and idicate their state (e.g., the minus button is disabled if quantity is 1). All actions (remove, close, increase/decrease, checkout, view cart) are clearly visible. Information is grouped: header at top, scrollable items list, total pricing in a highlighted footer, and action buttons in a colored, prominent style. Colors use blue for primaries (#1654f7), soft gray backgrounds, and red for removes. Choices are made to maximize clarity, visibility, and affordances, using padding and spacing to avoid clutter.

Question 2: The widget appears when a user clicks on the shopping cart icon or “Cart” button in the navigation bar, signaling interest to review or purchase their current items. It overlays the page but only appears on the explicit user action.

Question 3: Users can close the cart, adjust item quantities (with minus disabled at 1 to prevent zero), remove an item, view a detailed cart page, or proceed to checkout. Increasing or decreasing quantities will update item counts. Removing deletes the item and visually updates the list. Users cannot go below quantity 1 or proceed to checkout if the cart is empty (checkout would be disabled then). Feedback is given through button states, and actions are simple and consistent.
