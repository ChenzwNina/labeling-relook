Question 1: The widget features a white, rounded, card-like container with a subtle shadow and generous padding, set 20px from the top of the viewport. At the top, a navy-blue "Featured Products" title appears alongside a blue "See All" link. Below, products display in a responsive grid. Each card has a soft blue-gray background, product image, bold product name, green price, gold star rating, and a prominent blue "Add to Cart" button. The style prioritizes clarity, separation of functions, and strong affordances. Colors convey action/reward (blue/green) and feedback, while sizing ensures easy readability and touch targets.

  Question 2: This widget appears by default at the top of the e-commerce site's homepage or landing page, designed to immediately present featured products to users browsing the site.

  Question 3: Users can browse the featured products, click the product card for more details (if linked in a full implementation), click "Add to Cart" for any product (with button disabling or feedback upon adding in a full implementation), and access all featured items via the "See All" link. The interface is accessible via keyboard and screen readers, and all actionable elements offer hover/focus feedback for clarity.
