Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners. The image takes up the top section (280px wide, 200px tall), followed by product details below. I used a blue accent color for price and primary button (#2a5885) for visual hierarchy, with gray secondary elements for balance. The layout is organized with clear typography sizing (18px title, 20px price, 14px description) for easy scanning. These choices create a professional, accessible design that highlights key product information while maintaining visual appeal.

    Question 2: This widget appears as part of a product listing page in an ecommerce site, typically triggered when a user browses a category or searches for products. It may also appear in recommendation sections based on user behavior or as part of promotional displays.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product image, title, price, and description at a glance; 2) Click "Add to Cart" to initiate purchase; 3) Click "View Details" to see more information; 4) Hover over the card to see a subtle lift effect (visual feedback). The design supports quick decision-making while providing pathways for deeper engagement when needed.
