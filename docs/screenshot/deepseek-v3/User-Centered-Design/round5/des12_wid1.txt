Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are full-width with light borders, and the submit button is green for positive action. The layout is centered with proper spacing between elements. These choices create a professional, accessible interface that's easy to use on any device while maintaining visual hierarchy.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks "Sign Up" or "Create Account" in the website's header/navigation, or when attempting to checkout without an account. It might also appear as a modal overlay or on a dedicated registration page.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in form fields (name, email, passwords), 2) Submit the form (with validation), 3) Click the login link to switch to login mode, and 4) See real-time validation feedback (not implemented here). The form prevents submission until all required fields are properly filled.
