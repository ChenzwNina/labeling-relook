Question 1: The widget features a gradient banner (red to dark blue) with white text for high contrast. Deal items are in semi-transparent cards with hover effects. I chose vibrant colors to attract attention while maintaining readability. The layout uses flexbox for responsive arrangement, with adequate spacing between elements. Buttons have rounded corners for a modern look and include hover animations to encourage interaction.

    Question 2: The banner appears automatically when the page loads, as it's placed in the document body. In a real implementation, it might be triggered by page visit timing, user behavior, or special promotions. The close button allows dismissal, which could be remembered via localStorage.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Click deal buttons to navigate to relevant pages, 2) Hover over deal items to see subtle elevation effects, 3) Close the banner entirely using the Ã— button. Each interaction provides visual feedback (color changes, animations) to confirm the action. The design balances discoverability with optional engagement.
