Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background (#fff) and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a red cancel button (#e74c3c) for urgency/action, contrasting with a neutral keep membership button. The 400px width ensures readability while fitting most screens. Font sizes (22px heading, 14px body) follow hierarchy best practices. The layout is organized with clear spacing between elements (20px margins) to prevent visual crowding. These choices prioritize clarity, ease of use, and visual hierarchy while maintaining brand consistency.
    
    Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to account settings and selects "Cancel Membership" or clicks a similar cancellation link. This intentional action ensures users don't accidentally trigger cancellation. The modal appears centered over a dimmed background to focus attention on the decision while allowing return to the main interface via the "Keep Membership" button.
    
    Question 3: Users can: 1) Select a cancellation reason from a dropdown (required), 2) Add optional comments in a textarea, 3) Click "Cancel Membership" to confirm (triggers verification), or 4) Click "Keep Membership" to dismiss. The interface validates that a reason is selected before allowing cancellation. Hover states on buttons provide visual feedback. This flow captures essential feedback while preventing accidental cancellations.
