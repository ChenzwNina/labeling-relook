Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white search input on a light gray background. The search button is blue (#007bff) for visibility and turns darker on hover. Dropdown filters are compact but readable. I chose these colors for accessibility and brand consistency, with sufficient padding (12-15px) for touch targets. The layout prioritizes the search bar, then filters, then recent searches - following natural user flow.
    
    Question 2: This widget would typically appear in the header/navigation area of every page, always visible for immediate access. On mobile, it might collapse to an icon that expands when clicked. Some sites might trigger it when users click a search icon in the header.
    
    Question 3: Users can: (1) Type queries in the input field, (2) Click search button or press Enter, (3) Filter by category/price/sorting via dropdowns, (4) Click recent search tags to repeat searches, (5) On mobile, might swipe to dismiss or tap outside to close if it's an overlay.
