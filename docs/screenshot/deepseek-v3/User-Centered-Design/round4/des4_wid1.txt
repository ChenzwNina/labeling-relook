Question 1: The widget displays products in a responsive grid layout with cards. Each card has a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners for a modern look. Product images are 200px tall with consistent aspect ratio. Text is dark for readability against the white background, with price emphasized in bold. The "Add to Cart" button uses a blue color that darkens on hover. These choices create visual hierarchy, consistency, and emphasize interactivity while maintaining clean aesthetics.

    Question 2: This widget appears when users visit the products page or category page of the ecommerce site. It could also appear as a "Featured Products" section on the homepage or as search results when users perform a product search.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product images and details, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to purchase, 3) Hover over cards to see elevation effect (visual feedback), 4) Scroll through the grid if many products, 5) Click on products (though link functionality isn't implemented here) to view details. The responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes.
