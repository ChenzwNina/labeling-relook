Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based layout with a white background and subtle shadows. Product cards have a consistent 250px width with 200px tall images. I chose a green accent color for the "Add to Cart" button as it conveys action and positivity. The design uses ample white space and a responsive grid to ensure readability and accessibility across devices.
    
    Question 2: This widget appears automatically on the homepage or a dedicated "Featured" section. It could also be triggered by marketing campaigns, seasonal events, or when returning from product pages to showcase related items.
    
    Question 3: Users can hover over cards to see a subtle lift effect, click product images/titles to view details, and click "Add to Cart" buttons to purchase. The grid layout adapts to different screen sizes, and each card is independently interactive while maintaining visual consistency.
