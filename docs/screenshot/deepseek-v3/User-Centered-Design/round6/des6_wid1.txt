Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with a white background, subtle border, and soft shadow. It uses a blue accent color (#2a59a1) for prices and primary buttons to highlight important elements. The layout includes an image (280x200px), title (18px), rating stars, description (14px), price (20px bold), and two action buttons. These choices create visual hierarchy, ensure readability, and make the product stand out while maintaining a professional e-commerce aesthetic.

    Question 2: This widget appears as part of a product listing page or search results in an e-commerce website. It's triggered when the page loads products from the database, typically in a grid layout with multiple similar product items displayed simultaneously.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Hover to see a lift effect with enhanced shadow, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to add the item to their shopping cart, 3) Click "View Details" to navigate to the product page, and 4) Click the product image or title (if linked) for more information. The design provides clear visual feedback for all interactions.
