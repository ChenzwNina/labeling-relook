Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. It displays the average rating (4.7) in large bold text, gold stars for visual appeal, and the total review count. The rating distribution is shown as green percentage bars (color associated with positivity) with clear labels. I chose this design for readability, visual hierarchy, and to quickly convey key information while maintaining a professional e-commerce aesthetic.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear on product pages, triggered when a user views a product listing. It might also appear in search results for highly-rated products or as a pop-up after purchase asking for a review. The widget is always visible on product pages to help inform purchase decisions.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View the average rating and total reviews at a glance, 2) Scan the distribution of star ratings via the bar graph, 3) Click the "Write a Review" button to submit their own rating (which would open a review form), and 4) Potentially hover over elements for more details (like exact numbers on hover). The design encourages engagement while prioritizing information consumption.
