Question 1: The widget displays products in a responsive grid of cards (250px min width) with white backgrounds, subtle shadows, and rounded corners. Each card has a product image (200px height), title (16px), price (18px bold blue), and green "Add to Cart" button. The design uses clean typography, ample white space, and a hover effect for better usability. These choices create a modern, accessible interface that highlights products while maintaining visual hierarchy.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user visits a product category page or the homepage of an ecommerce site. It could also appear as search results or recommended products based on user browsing history.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product images and details, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to purchase, 3) Hover over cards to see a subtle lift effect, and 4) Responsively adjust the layout based on screen size. The grid automatically rearranges to fit different viewports, maintaining usability across devices.
