Question 1: The widget features a horizontal navigation bar with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow. Category links are dark gray (#333) with 16px font size, turning blue (#0d6efd) on hover/active. Dropdown menus appear below with white background and stronger shadow. The design prioritizes clarity and accessibility with sufficient spacing, readable typography, and visual feedback for interactions.

    Question 2: The widget appears as a persistent navigation element at the top of the ecommerce site. The dropdown menus trigger on hover over category items, appearing after a brief 0.3s transition. This hover-based activation provides quick access without requiring clicks.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Click category links to navigate to category pages, 2) Hover over categories to reveal dropdown submenus, 3) Click submenu items to navigate to subcategory pages, and 4) See visual feedback (color change, background highlight) during interactions. The active category is highlighted with blue text and light background.
