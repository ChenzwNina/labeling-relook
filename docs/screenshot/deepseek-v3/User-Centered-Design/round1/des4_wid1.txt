Question 1: The widget displays products in a responsive grid of cards (250px min width) with white backgrounds, subtle shadows, and rounded corners. Each card has a product image (200px height), title (16px), price (18px, blue), and green "Add to Cart" button. The clean design with ample white space enhances readability, while the hover effect and color contrast improve interactivity and visual hierarchy.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user visits a product category page or the homepage of an ecommerce site. It could also appear as search results or recommended products based on user browsing history. The component loads with the page content as a core part of the shopping experience.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Browse products in the responsive grid (layout adjusts to screen size), 2) Hover over cards to see a subtle lift effect, 3) Click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items, 4) View product images and details, and 5) Potentially click anywhere on the card to navigate to product detail pages (though this functionality isn't implemented in this basic version).
