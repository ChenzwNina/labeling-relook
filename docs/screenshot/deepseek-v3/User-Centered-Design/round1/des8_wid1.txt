Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. It uses green (#4CAF50) for the cart icon and checkout button to signify positive actions, and red (#e53935) for prices and badges to draw attention. The layout is organized with clear sections for items, quantity controls, and totals. Items are displayed with images, names, prices, and quantity adjusters. This design prioritizes usability with adequate spacing, readable fonts, and intuitive controls while maintaining visual appeal.

    Question 2: The widget appears when users click the shopping cart icon (a green circular button with a cart emoji) positioned in the top-right corner of the page. It can be dismissed by clicking either the 'Ã—' button in the cart's header or by clicking the cart icon again. This toggle functionality provides users with easy access while keeping the cart hidden when not needed.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View all cart items with images, names, prices, and quantities, 2) Adjust quantities using + and - buttons, 3) Remove items entirely via Remove buttons, 4) See a running total of all items, and 5) Proceed to checkout with the prominent green button. The cart also displays a badge with the item count on the icon. All interactions provide immediate visual feedback to confirm actions.
