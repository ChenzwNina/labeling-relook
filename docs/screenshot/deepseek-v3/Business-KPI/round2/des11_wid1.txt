Question 1: The widget features a clean, centered white card (400px wide) with soft shadows on a light gray background. It uses a red cancellation button for urgency, contrasting with a neutral gray "keep" button. Text is dark gray for readability with a bold heading. The layout is simple with clear hierarchy: heading, description, dropdown, text area, and action buttons. These choices create a professional, focused experience that guides users through cancellation while minimizing distractions.

    Question 2: The widget appears when a user clicks a "Cancel Membership" link in their account settings. This ensures it's only shown to users intentionally seeking to cancel, preventing accidental triggers while making it accessible when needed.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Select a cancellation reason from a dropdown, 2) Provide optional feedback in a text area, 3) Confirm cancellation with the red button, or 4) Change their mind using the "Keep Membership" button. The design captures essential feedback while allowing easy reversal of the decision.
