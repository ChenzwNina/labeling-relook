Question 1: The widget displays products in a responsive grid of cards with clean white backgrounds, subtle shadows, and rounded corners. Each card has a product image (200px height), title (16px), price (bold blue), and a green "Add to Cart" button. The design uses ample white space, consistent sizing, and hover effects for better usability. These choices create a modern, clean aesthetic that highlights products while maintaining readability and encouraging interaction.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user visits a product category page or the homepage of an ecommerce site. It could also appear as search results or recommended products based on user browsing history. The component loads with the page content as part of the main product listing interface.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Browse products in the grid layout, 2) Hover over cards to see elevation effect, 3) Click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items, 4) Click product images/titles to view details (though this functionality would need to be implemented with JavaScript). The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes, showing more or fewer columns accordingly.
