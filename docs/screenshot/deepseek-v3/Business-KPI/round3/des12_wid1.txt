Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white container on a light gray background. It uses a blue color scheme (#3498db) for interactive elements, which is common in ecommerce for trust and visibility. Input fields have ample padding (10px 12px) for comfortable typing, and the form is centered with a width of 350px for readability. Error messages appear in red (#e74c3c) below relevant fields. These choices prioritize usability, visual hierarchy, and mobile-friendliness while maintaining a professional appearance.

    Question 2: This account creation widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" button in the website's header/navigation, or when they attempt to checkout without an account. It could also appear as a modal overlay when clicking a call-to-action button on the homepage promoting member benefits.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in form fields (name, email, password) with real-time validation, 2) See error messages if inputs are invalid, 3) Submit the form to create an account (with success feedback), and 4) Click the "Sign in" link to switch to login if they already have an account. The form prevents submission until all fields are valid, and fields highlight when focused for better UX.
