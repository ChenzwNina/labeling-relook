Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and blue accent color (#4285f4). It's 350px wide with appropriate padding, making it responsive yet substantial. Input fields are full-width with clear labels, and the sign-in button is prominent with hover effects. These choices prioritize usability - the contrast ensures readability, the size makes it touch-friendly, and the layout follows conventional patterns users expect from sign-in forms.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when users click a "Sign In" link in the website's header/navigation, or when attempting to access account-specific features. It could also appear as a modal overlay or on a dedicated sign-in page, depending on the site's architecture.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Enter email and password in the form fields, 2) Submit the form by clicking the button or pressing Enter, 3) Click "Sign up" to register if they don't have an account, or 4) Click "Forgot password" to reset credentials. The form validates input (ensuring email format and required fields) before submission.
