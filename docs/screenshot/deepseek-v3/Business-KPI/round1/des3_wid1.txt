Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. The search input is prominent with ample padding (12px 15px) for easy interaction. Blue (#4285f4) is used for the search button as it's associated with action and contrasts well with white. Filter dropdowns are full-width with clear labels. The layout is organized hierarchically with search at top and filters below. These choices prioritize usability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks on the search icon in the website header or when they land on a search results page. It could also be triggered by keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+F) or automatically when entering certain pages that emphasize search functionality.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Type search queries in the input field, 2) Submit searches by clicking the button or pressing Enter, 3) Filter results by category, price range, and sort order via dropdowns, 4) Close the panel using the X button, 5) Tab through interactive elements for keyboard navigation. The interface provides visual feedback like hover effects on buttons and focus states on inputs.
