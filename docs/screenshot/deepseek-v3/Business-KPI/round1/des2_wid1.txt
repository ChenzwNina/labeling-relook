Question 1: The widget features a horizontal navigation bar with a light gray background (#f8f9fa) and subtle shadow for depth. Category links are dark gray (#333) with 500 font weight, turning blue (#0d6efd) on hover. Dropdown menus appear below categories with white background and stronger shadow. I chose these colors for good contrast and readability, with blue hover states for clear interactivity. The layout is clean and spacious with 20px gaps between categories and 8px padding on links for comfortable clicking.

    Question 2: The widget appears immediately as part of the page header, always visible to help users navigate. The dropdown menus appear on hover over category items, disappearing when the cursor moves away. This trigger ensures quick access without requiring clicks while preventing accidental activation.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Hover over categories to reveal dropdown menus, 2) Click category links to navigate to category pages, 3) Click dropdown items to navigate to subcategory pages, 4) Notice visual feedback (color change, background highlight) during interactions.
