Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based layout with a white background, subtle shadows, and blue accent buttons. Product cards are 250px wide with consistent image heights (200px) for visual harmony. The design uses a calming blue color scheme (#457b9d) for interactive elements to encourage clicks, with red (#e63946) for prices to draw attention. These choices create visual hierarchy, maintain consistency, and follow e-commerce best practices for conversion.

    Question 2: This widget appears automatically on the homepage or landing pages as a standard merchandising component. It could also appear contextually when users browse related categories or when returning visitors show interest in featured products. The appearance isn't triggered by user action but serves as a permanent promotional section.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Hover over cards to see a subtle lift effect, 2) Click product images/names to view details, 3) Click "Add to Cart" buttons to purchase, 4) Scroll horizontally if space is limited (responsive design), and 5) Potentially swipe on touch devices. The widget is designed to guide users toward these primary conversion actions while maintaining accessibility.
