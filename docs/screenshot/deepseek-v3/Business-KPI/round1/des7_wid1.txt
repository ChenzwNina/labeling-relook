Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. The gold stars (FFD700) stand out against the neutral colors, while the orange progress bars (FFA41C) provide visual feedback. The layout is organized hierarchically with the average rating most prominent (32px), followed by star distribution bars. This design ensures quick comprehension of ratings while maintaining visual appeal.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear on product pages, triggered when a user views an item. It loads automatically with the page content to provide immediate social proof about the product's quality and popularity.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View the average rating and total reviews at a glance, 2) Scan the distribution of star ratings, 3) Potentially click to read individual reviews (though this functionality isn't implemented in this basic version), and 4) Compare rating distributions between different products.
