Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a green (#4CAF50) progress bar to indicate order status, with gray for inactive steps. The layout is organized vertically with clear section hierarchy: header, progress visualization, details, and actions. I chose these colors for good contrast and accessibility, with green signaling progress/completion. The size is optimized for readability (500px max-width) with appropriate spacing between elements.

    Question 2: This widget would appear when a user clicks on "Track Order" from their account page or order confirmation email. It could also appear automatically after checkout completion, or when accessing a direct tracking link. The trigger is always user-initiated action related to viewing order status.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View their order progress through the visual timeline, 2) See key details like delivery estimate and tracking number, 3) Click "Track Package" to open carrier tracking, 4) Click "Contact Support" for order assistance, 5) Potentially expand sections for more details if implemented. The widget is primarily informational but includes actionable buttons for common next steps.
