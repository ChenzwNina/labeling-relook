Question 1: The widget has a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. It uses green (#4CAF50) for primary actions and red (#e53935) for important indicators. The layout is organized with clear sections (header, items list, footer), adequate spacing, and readable typography. These choices enhance usability - the color contrast draws attention to key elements, the spacing prevents visual clutter, and the fixed position ensures accessibility without disrupting the shopping experience.

    Question 2: The widget appears when users click the shopping cart icon (green circular button with a cart icon) positioned at the top-right of the screen. This icon is always visible and includes a red badge showing item count. Clicking either the icon or the close button (Ã—) in the widget's header toggles the cart's visibility.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View all cart items with images, names, prices, 2) Adjust quantities (+/- buttons), 3) Remove items entirely, 4) See a running subtotal, 5) Proceed to checkout via the prominent green button, and 6) Close the cart when finished. The widget supports all fundamental cart operations while maintaining simplicity.
