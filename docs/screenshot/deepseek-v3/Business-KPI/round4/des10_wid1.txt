Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and blue accent color for the button. It's 350px wide with rounded corners and subtle shadow for depth. Text uses dark gray for headings and lighter gray for body text, ensuring good contrast. The layout is organized with clear sections for benefits and form fields. These choices create a professional, trustworthy appearance while maintaining readability and visual hierarchy to guide users through the signup process.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Join Membership" or "Sign Up" button in the website header, or as a popup after adding items to cart (to encourage signups). It might also appear as a persistent element on certain pages for first-time visitors.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Read membership benefits, 2) Enter email and password in form fields with validation, 3) Submit the form (triggering validation checks), 4) See error messages if inputs are invalid, and 5) Upon successful submission, would typically see a confirmation message (not shown in this example). The hover effect on the button provides visual feedback.
