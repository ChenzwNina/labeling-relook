Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are full-width with light gray borders, and the submit button is a prominent blue color. I chose these colors for accessibility and visual hierarchy, with sufficient padding for touch targets. The layout is centered with clear labels above each field following modern form design best practices.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" button in the website's header/navigation, or when attempting to checkout without an account. It could also appear as a modal overlay or on a dedicated registration page.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in text fields (name, email, password) with validation, 2) Submit the form which triggers client-side validation, 3) Click the "Sign in" link if they already have an account, and 4) Close the widget if it's a modal (though this implementation doesn't show that functionality). Error messages would appear for invalid inputs.
