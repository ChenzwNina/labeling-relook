Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners. The image takes the full width with fixed height (200px), followed by product details below. I used a blue primary button (#1976d2) for the main action (Add to Cart) and a light gray secondary button. The price stands out in green (#2e7d32) to emphasize value. These choices create visual hierarchy, focus attention on key elements, and maintain a professional e-commerce aesthetic while ensuring good readability and usability.

    Question 2: This product widget would appear as part of a product listing page, category page, or search results in an e-commerce site. It could also appear in recommendation sections ("Customers also bought") or promotional displays. The component is designed to be reusable across different contexts where individual products need to be displayed.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product image, title, price, rating, and description at a glance. 2) Click "Add to Cart" to purchase. 3) Click "Save" to add to wishlist. 4) Hover over the card to see a subtle lift effect (visual feedback). The entire card could be made clickable to view product details, though this implementation focuses on the explicit action buttons for clarity.
