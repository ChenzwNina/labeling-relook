Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a blue color scheme (#3498db) for the primary button, which creates a strong call-to-action. The form inputs have ample padding (12px) for comfortable interaction, and the rounded corners (5-10px) make the component feel friendly. The typography uses a sans-serif font with appropriate hierarchy (larger headings, smaller body text). These choices create a professional yet approachable look that builds trust while maintaining usability.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Join Membership" or "Sign Up" button in the website header/navigation, or it might appear as a popup after a user has browsed the site for a certain period. It could also be shown during checkout as an upsell opportunity when non-members are making a purchase.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in form fields (name, email, password) with validation, 2) Submit the form (triggering confirmation), 3) View the membership benefits list, and 4) Close the widget (though this functionality would need to be added based on implementation context). The form provides immediate feedback with field highlighting on focus and validation for required fields and password length.
