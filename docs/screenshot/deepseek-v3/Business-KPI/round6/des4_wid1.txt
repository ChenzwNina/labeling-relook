Question 1: The widget displays products in a responsive grid layout with white cards on a light gray background. Each card has a product image (200px height), title (16px), price (18px, blue), and a green "Add to Cart" button. The design uses clean typography, subtle shadows, and hover effects for better visual hierarchy and user experience. The color choices (green for action buttons, blue for prices) follow ecommerce conventions for familiarity.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user visits a product category page or search results page. It could also appear as a "Featured Products" section on the homepage or as recommended products on product detail pages.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Browse products in the grid layout, 2) Hover over cards to see a subtle lift effect, 3) Click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items to their cart, 4) Click product images or titles to view more details (though this functionality would need to be implemented with JavaScript). The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes.
