Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with white background and subtle shadow. It's 280px wide with a product image (200px height), title (18px), price (20px, blue), and description (14px, gray). Buttons are green (primary) and light gray (secondary). The design emphasizes readability, visual hierarchy, and a modern aesthetic while maintaining sufficient white space. Hover effects provide interactivity feedback.

    Question 2: This product widget appears as part of a product listing page or search results in an e-commerce site. It can also appear in recommendation sections, category pages, or promotional displays. The appearance is triggered by page load or dynamic content loading when users browse products.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Hover to see elevation effect, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to add the item, 3) Click "View Details" to see more information, 4) Click the product image/title to navigate to the product page. The widget may also support quick view on hover in some implementations, though not shown in this basic version.
