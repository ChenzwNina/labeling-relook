Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background for product cards against a light gray backdrop. Product cards are 250px wide with consistent 200px tall images. I chose a responsive grid layout to accommodate different screen sizes, with green call-to-action buttons for visibility. The design emphasizes product images and prices while maintaining enough white space for readability.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear on the homepage or category pages of an ecommerce site. It could be triggered by page load, user navigation to specific sections, or based on user browsing history/personalization algorithms that determine which products to feature.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product images and details, 2) Click "Add to Cart" buttons, 3) Hover over cards for subtle elevation effects that indicate interactivity. The component could be expanded to include quick view modals, wishlist icons, or rating displays for more interaction options.
