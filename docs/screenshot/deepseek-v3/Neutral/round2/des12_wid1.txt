Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and blue accents. It's 350px wide with ample padding (30px) and rounded corners. Input fields are full-width with subtle borders, and the submit button is a prominent blue that darkens on hover. This design ensures readability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy while maintaining a professional ecommerce aesthetic.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" button in the website's header/navigation, or when they attempt to checkout without an account. It might also appear as a popup/modal or on a dedicated registration page.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in text fields (name, email, password) with validation, 2) Submit the form (triggering client-side validation), 3) Click the login link to switch to login mode, and 4) See visual feedback (hover states, error messages). The form prevents submission until all required fields are valid.
