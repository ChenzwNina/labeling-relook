Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and dark blue header (#2c3e50) for contrast. Items are displayed in a scrollable list with clear product images (60x60px), names, prices in red (#e74c3c) for visibility, and quantity controls. The fixed 350px width ensures readability without dominating the screen. These choices prioritize usability - clear visual hierarchy, sufficient spacing, and intuitive controls create a frictionless shopping experience while maintaining brand consistency through the color scheme.

    Question 2: The widget appears when users click the red shopping cart icon (with item count badge) positioned fixed at the top-right of the screen. This icon is always visible, providing constant access to the cart. Clicking either the icon again or the close button (×) in the cart header hides the widget. This toggle mechanism offers quick access without disrupting the shopping flow.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View all cart items with images, details, and prices, 2) Adjust quantities via +/- buttons or direct input, 3) Remove items via the trash icon, 4) See real-time price updates, 5) Proceed to checkout via the prominent red button. The widget also displays a persistent item count badge. All interactions provide visual feedback (hover states, smooth transitions) to confirm actions and maintain user orientation.
