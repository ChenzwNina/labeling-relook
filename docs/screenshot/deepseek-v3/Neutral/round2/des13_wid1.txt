Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and blue accent color (#4285f4). It's 350px wide with ample padding (30px), rounded corners (8px radius), and subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are full-width with 12px padding, clear labels, and placeholder text. The sign-in button is prominent with a hover effect. These choices prioritize usability - the clean layout reduces cognitive load, the blue color conveys trust, and the sizing ensures comfortable interaction on all devices.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Sign In" link in the website's header/navigation, or when attempting to access account-specific features while unauthenticated. It could also appear as a modal overlay or on a dedicated sign-in page, depending on the site's architecture.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Enter email and password in the respective fields, 2) Submit the form by clicking the button or pressing Enter, 3) Click "Forgot password" to initiate password recovery, 4) Click "Create account" to navigate to registration. The form validates inputs (ensures email format and required fields) before submission. Successful authentication would redirect to their account or previous page.
