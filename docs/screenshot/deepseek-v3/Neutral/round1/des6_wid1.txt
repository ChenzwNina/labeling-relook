Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners. The image takes up top space (200px height), followed by product details below. I used a green color for the CTA button (good for conversions), blue for price (trust), and yellow stars for ratings (familiar). The 280px width makes it responsive for grid layouts. Hover effects (lift and shadow) enhance interactivity.

    Question 2: This widget appears as part of a product listing page or search results in an e-commerce site. It's triggered when the page loads products from the database. It could also appear in recommendation sections based on user behavior or in modal windows when quick-viewing products.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Click the product image/title to view details, 2) Click the heart icon to add to wishlist (visual feedback would confirm), 3) Click "Add to Cart" (button changes color temporarily), 4) Hover to see the card lift effect. The rating stars could be clickable for leaving reviews if implemented.
