Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a light gray background and white product cards. Product titles are bold and dark for readability, while prices are in red to draw attention. Cards use subtle shadows and hover effects (lifting up) to indicate interactivity. The responsive grid layout ensures good display on all screen sizes. These choices create visual hierarchy, emphasize key information, and provide clear affordances for interaction while maintaining a professional ecommerce aesthetic.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear on the homepage or landing pages of an ecommerce site, loading automatically when the page loads. It might also appear on category pages when filtered by "featured" items, or could be triggered by user actions like clicking a "Featured Products" tab in a product browsing section.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product images and details at a glance, 2) Hover over cards to see a lift animation indicating clickability, 3) Click "Add to Cart" buttons to add items to their cart, 4) Click anywhere on a product card (which would typically link to the product detail page in a full implementation). The grid layout also allows for easy scanning of multiple products simultaneously.
