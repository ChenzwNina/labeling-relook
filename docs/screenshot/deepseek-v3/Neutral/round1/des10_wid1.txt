Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and blue accent color for the button. It's 350px wide with rounded corners and subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are full-width with clear labels. The design prioritizes usability with adequate spacing, contrasting colors for readability, and visual hierarchy (title > form > benefits). The blue button stands out as the primary action. These choices create an inviting, professional look that builds trust while making the form easy to complete.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Join Membership" or "Sign Up" link in the website header/navigation, or as a popup when a non-member views premium content. It could also appear as a persistent sidebar option or after adding items to cart for non-members.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in form fields (name, email, password) with validation, 2) Submit the form (triggering success feedback), 3) View membership benefits listed below the form. The email field validates format, password requires 8+ characters, and all fields are mandatory. On submission, users receive confirmation. Hover effects on the button provide visual feedback. The clean layout makes all interactions intuitive.
