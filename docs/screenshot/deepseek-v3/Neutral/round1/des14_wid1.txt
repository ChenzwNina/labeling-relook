Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with white background and subtle shadow for depth. It uses a green color scheme (#4caf50) for active/completed steps and primary actions, conveying progress and success. The layout is organized hierarchically with order details at the top, visual progress indicator in the middle, and detailed information below. I chose this design for clarity - the progress bar visually communicates status at a glance, while the clean typography and ample white space make information easily scannable. The size (max-width: 500px) ensures it works well on both mobile and desktop.

    Question 2: This widget appears when a user clicks on "Track Order" from their account page or order confirmation email. It may also automatically display after checkout completion for new orders. The trigger could be a direct link from customer service communications regarding order status updates.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View their order status and progress through the visual timeline, 2) See detailed shipping information (carrier, tracking number, ETA), 3) Click "Track Package" to open carrier tracking in a new tab, 4) Click "Contact Support" to initiate a help request about this order, 5) Potentially cancel/edit orders if in early stages (not shown in this example but could be added for processing status).
