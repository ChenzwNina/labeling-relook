Question 1: The widget features a clean, modern design with a white background and subtle shadows for depth. It uses a green color scheme for interactive elements (like the checkout button) to encourage conversions, and red for prices to highlight costs. The layout is organized with clear sections (header, items list, footer) and ample spacing. Items display images, names, prices, and quantity controls in a compact format. These choices prioritize usability, visual hierarchy, and mobile-friendliness while maintaining a professional e-commerce aesthetic.

    Question 2: The widget appears when users click the shopping cart icon (green circular button with a cart icon and item count) positioned in the top-right corner of the page. It slides in from the right side as a sidebar overlay. Clicking the same cart icon or the close button (Ã—) in the cart header will hide the widget again.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View all cart items with images, names, and prices, 2) Adjust quantities with +/- buttons, 3) Remove items entirely, 4) See a running total, and 5) Proceed to checkout. The widget updates dynamically (though not fully implemented in this demo) to reflect changes. All interactive elements provide visual feedback on hover/click to confirm actions.
