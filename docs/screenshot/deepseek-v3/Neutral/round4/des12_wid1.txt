Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and blue accents. It's 350px wide with rounded corners and subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are full-width with light borders, and the submit button is a prominent blue. These choices create a professional, trustworthy appearance while ensuring usability. The layout is simple and intuitive, reducing cognitive load for users.

    Question 2: This widget would typically appear when a user clicks a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" button in the website's header or when attempting to checkout without an account. It might also appear as a modal overlay when first-time visitors land on product pages.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Fill in text fields for name, email, and password; 2) Submit the form (triggering validation); 3) Click the login link to switch to login mode; 4) The form validates inputs in real-time (though not fully implemented in this example). Error messages would appear for invalid entries on submission.
