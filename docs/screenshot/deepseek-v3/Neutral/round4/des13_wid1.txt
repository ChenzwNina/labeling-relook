Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are spacious (350px wide) with 12px padding for comfortable typing. The blue (#4285f4) sign-in button provides strong visual contrast. These choices prioritize usability - ample spacing reduces errors, the color scheme maintains brand consistency while ensuring readability, and the centered layout focuses attention on the task.

    Question 2: This sign-in widget would typically appear when users click a "Sign In" link in the website header, or when attempting to access account-specific features like checkout or wishlists. It could also appear as a modal overlay or on a dedicated sign-in page.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Enter email and password in the clearly labeled fields, 2) Submit the form via button click or Enter key, 3) Navigate to sign-up via the link, 4) Access password recovery. The form validates inputs (ensuring email format and required fields) before submission. Hover effects on interactive elements provide visual feedback.
