Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners. The image takes top prominence, followed by title, rating, description, price, and action buttons. I chose a 280px width for good mobile responsiveness, with sufficient padding (16px) for readability. The color scheme uses blue for primary actions (add to cart) and gray for secondary, with green for price to emphasize value. These choices create visual hierarchy while maintaining a professional, accessible look.

    Question 2: This product widget appears as part of a product listing page or search results in an ecommerce site. It can also appear in recommendation sections (like "similar items" or "customers also bought") on product detail pages. The trigger is the page load or dynamic loading when scrolling through product listings.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Click the image/title to view product details, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to purchase, 3) Click "Wishlist" to save for later, 4) Hover to see elevation effect (visual feedback), and 5) Read ratings/reviews to assess quality. The card is also responsive to different screen sizes, adapting its layout accordingly.
