Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with white background and subtle shadows for depth. It uses a 400px width container with ample padding, making it easy to focus on. The color scheme uses red for the cancel button (urgent action) and neutral tones for other elements. Font sizes are legible (16px body, 24px heading) with proper spacing. These choices create a professional, focused interface that guides users through cancellation while minimizing distractions.

    Question 2: The widget appears when a user navigates to account settings and selects "Cancel Membership" or clicks a similar cancellation link. It could also appear as a modal when users attempt to downgrade from a premium membership.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Select a cancellation reason from a dropdown, 2) Provide optional feedback in a textarea, 3) Click "Cancel Membership" to confirm (triggering backend cancellation), or 4) Click "Keep Membership" to abort cancellation. The interface provides clear visual feedback on hover states and maintains focus on the primary action (cancellation) while offering an easy exit path.
