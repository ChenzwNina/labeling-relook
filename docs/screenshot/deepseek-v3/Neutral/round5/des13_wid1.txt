Question 1: The widget features a clean, minimalist design with a white background and blue accent color (#4285f4). It's 350px wide with ample padding (30px), rounded corners (8px), and a subtle shadow for depth. Input fields are full-width with 12px padding, and the sign-in button is prominent with bold text. These choices create a professional, accessible interface that aligns with e-commerce trustworthiness while maintaining visual appeal.

    Question 2: The sign-in widget would typically appear when users click a "Sign In" link in the website header, or when attempting to access account-specific features like checkout or order history while not logged in. It could also appear as a modal overlay or on a dedicated sign-in page.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) Enter email and password in the form fields, 2) Click the sign-in button to submit credentials, 3) Navigate to sign-up via the "Sign up" link, or 4) Access password recovery via "Forgot password". The form validates input (requires email format and non-empty password) before submission. Hover states provide visual feedback for interactive elements.
