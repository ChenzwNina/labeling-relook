Question 1: The widget features a clean, card-based design with a white background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners. The image takes up the top section, followed by product details below. I used a blue primary button (#4285f4) for the main action (Add to Cart) and a light gray secondary button. The price is highlighted in red (#e53935) to draw attention. The design choices prioritize clarity, visual hierarchy, and mobile responsiveness while maintaining a modern aesthetic.

    Question 2: This product widget appears as part of a product listing page or search results in an e-commerce website. It can also appear in recommendation sections, related products, or featured product carousels. The appearance is triggered by the page loading or user navigation to product display sections.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product image, title, price and description, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to add the item to their shopping cart, 3) Click "View Details" to see more product information, 4) Hover over the card to see a subtle lift effect. The design provides visual feedback for all interactive elements.
