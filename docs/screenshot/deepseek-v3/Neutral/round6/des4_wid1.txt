Question 1: The widget displays products in a responsive grid layout with clean white cards on a light gray background. Each card has a product image (200px height), title (16px), price (18px, blue), and a green "Add to Cart" button. I chose this design for clarity and visual appeal - white cards stand out against the background, the grid adapts to screen size, and the hover effect adds interactivity. The green button draws attention to the primary action.

    Question 2: This product list widget would typically appear when a user visits a category page or the homepage of the e-commerce site. It could also appear as search results or recommended products based on user behavior.

    Question 3: Users can: 1) View product images and details, 2) Click "Add to Cart" to purchase, 3) Hover over cards to see a subtle lift effect (visual feedback), and 4) On mobile, tap cards for potential expansion. The grid layout also responds to screen size changes.
